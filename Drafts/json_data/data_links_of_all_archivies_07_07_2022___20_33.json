            "Abstract": "The article examines the evidences of the early hagiographic tradition about the attitude of Christians to Rome. For the martyrs themselves,\u00a0\u00a0who were striving for death, the opposition to the Romans did not matter, but this topic could attract the attention of the authors and editors of the acta and passions. The surviving texts do not directly accuse Christians of conspiracy, nor are there obvious manifestations of their political disloyalty, but some of the ideas contained in them make it possible to understand the concerns of the Romans. First of all, this is the attitude of Christians to the Cult of the Emperor: the refusal of the martyrs to celebrate it put them outside the law, turning them into traitors and a threat to the State. They opposed the eternal Kingdom of God and the temporary power of Caesars. The Roman identity was replaced by the Christian one: martyrs considered themselves as citizens not of Rome, but of the Kingdom of God. Christians pointed out that the Emperor was ordained by God, which means that His instructions and commandments were more important. The execution of the martyrs, which was supposed to humiliate them, turned into a celebration of faith, which violated the established ritual of maintaining Roman order. The convicted Christian disturbed the usual course of events, he welcomed torture, rejoiced in death and supervised his own execution. Finally, the texts of the martyrdom are typologically similar to Acta Alexandrinorum, records of the trial and execution of pagans who criticized Rome. Observing the evolution of the image of Roman magistrates, we see how gradually the clashof the martyr and the entire Roman order turned into a conflict between a virtuous Christian and an evil governor of the province, thus removing the responsibility for the persecution from the Emperor."

            "Abstract": "The issue (or even the riddle) of Circumcellions, rebels and persecutors of Roman landowners and Catholic priests, had long attracted the scholarly attention. Deriving their views from the writings of Optate, Augustine and later authors, and also from a fragment of the Theodosian Code, modern historians perceive Circumcellions in different ways. Their treatment depends much on their actual research field and their source priority. For example, Ch. Saumagne, pre\u2011ferring the legal source, considered Circumcellions as a certain social group \u2014 agricultural wage laborers; some later scholars, like T. B\u00fcttner and E. Tengstr\u00f6m, based their research on the same concept. Others regarded Circumcellions as an issue of the Church history and precisely of the Donatist schism (W.H.C. Frend). Modern historians view the stories of Optate and Augustine from more unexpected perspective: as a form of rural Christianity (L. Dossey) and popular asceticism (B. Pottier). B. Shaw made an attempt to revive Saumagne\u2019s theory. Today our notion of Circumcellions is more complex. They seem to be a certain mixture of lower-class rural population and a certain form of popular Christianity, manifesting itself in ways proper for that crowd: asceticism, martyrdom, and \u201crighteous\u201d violence."

            "Abstract": "The secular cult of the fallen heroes \u2014 martyrs of the revolution became the most important component of the Bolshevik historical mythology of the early Soviet period (1917\u20131920s). This cult clearly showed a religious origin and a number of differences from the cult of heroes of the later Soviet era. The early revolutionary martyrdom, from February 1917 and the first months after October 1917, developed as a collective and largely anonymous, symbolic phenomenon. These features were also evident in the early martyriums, the mass graves on the Field of Mars in Petrograd and near the Kremlin Wall in Moscow. However, the Bolsheviks\u2019 creation of their own, revolutionary secular pantheon based on religious models later individualized martyrdom and developed its special criteria. A sign of individualization was the compilation of martyrologies and the formation of practices of veneration of martyrs\u2019 burial places. The cult of martyrs acquired an international character through inclusion in the pantheon of the victims of revolutionary events in Europe. The discursive tropes formed to describe heroic martyrdom initially normalized only violent death at the hands of the enemy. After the end of the Civil War, however, the emerging linguistic ritualization allowed for the heroization of the circumstances of death: those who died of illness, accidents, even suicides were counted as martyrs. Gradually the number of heroes was reduced while the range of their types was, on the contrary, expanded. The martyr hero took an increasingly modest place in the hierarchy of heroes, the tropes of describing martyrdom weresimplified and standardized, and their biographies were straightened and taken on a symbolic rather than an individual form."

            "Abstract": "The practice of glorification and \u201ccivil canonization\u201d of heroes of revolutions and wars in Soviet Russia started in the first years after the 1917 Revolution and continued throughout the entire period of the existence of the USSR. In the article, the author uses specific examples to consider how these practices were carried out in public discourse, first in the USSR, and then in Russia, in relation to Soviet military \u2014 participants in the war in Afghanistan (1979\u20131989). The author explores the transformation of the image of the Afghan veterans in the 1980s, which included some elements of martyrdom. The author relies primarily on the materials of late Soviet military journalism. Then the article deals with the post-Soviet practices of glorification of the Afghan veterans and their relationship with the continuity of the cult of the veterans of the previous wars, especially the Great Patriotic War. The author concludes that in the modern public discourse, the characteristics of Christian martyrs are directly transferred to the image of the \u201cAfgantsy\u201d, which was not the case in the Soviet period when their exploits were mainly placed within the revolutionary narratives and secular martyrdom."

            "Abstract": "This article is an attempt to analyze the problem of understanding and defining the phenomenon of martyrdom in relation to the history and culture of India. The application of the concept of \u201cmartyrdom\u201d to different (in particular, non-Abrahamic) religions and to different societies poses a number of problems related to the cross-cultural conceptualization of this phenomenon and the application of the very term \u201cmartyrdom\u201d or its analogues to those cultures where sucha concept was initially absent. Being originally Christian, the concept of martyrdom undergoes all kinds of transformations and modifications as applied to different contexts. We therefore start with defining some key criteria of the phenomenon. First, it is the presence of external forces and circumstances causing the death of a martyr; second, it is a reference to some good ideas or goals for which the martyr died; third, it is a posthumous memory and veneration, directly related to the death of a martyr who thus becomes a role model. The authors single out three possible models of martyrdom, known in the history and culture of India: shahadat \u2014 suffering and death for one\u2019s beliefs, both religious and political, underlying the modern Indian national \u201cpantheon\u201d of martyrs; the kshatriya model, associated with military ethics; and the vernacular model, which underlies the formation of locally worshiped deities and deified heroes."

The article shows the beginning of the Jesuit mission in Japan, their strategies and certain errors, as well as their activities in the time of persecution. The article then illustrates how the spread of Christianity in Japan at its different stages was related to the local politics. The persecution and extermination of Christianity in the country should be analyzed in this context. The unique feature of the Japanese Christian Martyrdom was the Christians\u2019 explicit willingness to die as martyrs. This attitude is explained with the reference to some elements of the Japanese traditional mentality, which might be consistent with some Christian concepts."

            "Abstract": "The article deals with the theoretical and empirical development of a model within the framework of the constructivist theory of martyrdom: the analysis of martyrdom as a \u201creputational project\u201d. Within this general theory, martyrdom is considered not as an objective event of someone\u2019s violent death for certain beliefs, but as its interpretation \u2014 a post-factum created narrative anchored in the collective memory of the community. This means that martyrs are rather\u201cmade\u201d than \u201cappear\u201d. The author\u2019s conceptualization of martyrdom as a reputational project focuses on the individual or collective subject of this narrative (a \u201creputational entrepreneur\u201d in the terminology of sociologist Gary A. Fine); on the raw material, symbolic and human resources available to them, as well as specific situational prerequisites for the project to succeed or fail. The article proposes a three-part typology of entrepreneurs and exemplifies each type with case studies. These are (1) \u201cautobiographical\u201d entrepreneurs, who initiate a project concerning themselves; (2) \u201cbiographers\u201d, who initiate a project concerning someone else; (3) \u201cdiffuse\u201d entrepreneur, which is a collective entity. Finally, the article analyzes the cases where a reputational project was initiated but failed or turned out to be unclaimed, leaving a person unrecognized as a legitimate martyr. Stemming from some case studies, the author makes assumptions on why some such projects succeed, while others failed, and also, why some martyrs become more popular than others. At the end of the article, there is a list of the main prerequisites and circumstances that affect the outcome of the project: the quality of the original hagiographic data; its conformity with an established religious tradition; the presence or absence of a decent \u201ccause,\u201d for which the martyr allegedly died; the request from a community; the"

They debated over the ways the local problems could be combined with the challenges of the current imperial reforms; the reforms of Muslim education; the process of Tatar/Turkic national consolidation, etc. The analysis of the language of publications and of the additional archival sources show that such debates were motivated by the particular interests of certain involved groups (reformers, newspapers editors, merchants) rather than the desire for detailed and comprehensive analysis of the situation of a particular region. The conclusion is that the analyzed debates were, in most cases, a competition of certain linguistic strategies, rather than a real discussion of efficient reforms."

Ethnographic data collected in New Age pilgrimage in southern Russia demonstrate that the identification with beliefs and narratives is not the main indicator of belonging. Despite the traditionalist background of pilgrimage, its activists would not always have complete agreement on key ideas of esoteric traditionalism. It is important to rely upon the data demonstrating practices people are involved in instead of information about how they identify themselves."

The experience of distance church life\u201d in April\u2011June 2020 has shown that both the mediatization of Orthodoxy and the development of Orthodox segment of the internet reached a fundamentally new stage. The author examines this stage using the concept of participatory culture introduced by Henry Jenkins and the cultural studies approaches based on the categories of interactivity and immersion. The shared experience of online worship over a span of several months and the degree of participants\u2019 co\u2011presence and emotional involvement point to a new level of mediatization that entailed the production and consumption of textual, audio and video content in the course of vertical and horizontal communication. This experience also showed the active development of participatory practices, including the strengthening of interactivity of worship, the unprecedented intensity of immersion, and the prospects of substantial changes in the liturgical life driven by digitalization."

We turn to the concepts of authority and legitimacy; the ideas of Brian Turner on the performative role of in\u2011 formation technology for the institution of religious authority; Gary Bunt\u2019s discussion of the democratization of Islamic knowledge in the online environment; Olivier Roy\u2019s concept of individualization of Islam; and Peter Mandaville\u2019s idea of decentralization of power in the Islamic tradition. This study seeks to answer two interrelated questions: who and how reinterprets the category of Islamic piety in the context of the pandemic and to what extent the online environment transforms the Islamic tradition as a whole. Based on textual analysis of individual publications on social networks and interviews with editors of public websites, the common narratives of Russian Muslim discourse on the pandemic were identified as follows: a retaliation against China for the oppression of Muslim Uighurs; the search for the signs of the coming doomsday; various approaches to the reinterpretation of religious piety. We suggest the term \u201cpopular\u201d or \u201cspontaneous\u201d ijtihad to describe the variety of individualized strategies stimulated by the crisis. The construction of these strategies would not have been possible without the virtual environment, characterized by the polyarchic community of \u201conline ulema\u201d and the digitalization of religious practices."

I compare two ceremonies: commemoration of the General\u2019s spirit in the temple in his native village in H\u1ea3i D\u01b0\u01a1ng province on May 1, 2018 (my own fieldwork) and a closed ceremony in the same temple which were broadcasted on the Internet on April 8, 2020. The feast in honor of a rural spirit, previously the most popular village event, was reduced to a ceremony with offerings and prayers in front of the altar which was performed by the representatives of \u0110o\u00e0n clan. On the one hand, this version of the ceremony weakens the integration of the village community and eliminates such an important religious practice as pilgrimage. On the other hand, restrictive measures brought the ceremony closer to its traditional form: ordinary community members, women, tourists were excluded from participation in the rituals, while the \u0110o\u00e0n clan\u2019s members directly communicated with the spirits, the way it is prescribed by tradition."

            "Abstract": "This article discusses theoretical issues behind the current shift in the policy of European states towards Islamic communities. The shift is driven by the idea that the values of political Islam are incompatible with Western values; that the main driver behind radicalization is ideology and that even non\u2011violent Islamists gradually prepare the Muslim youth to embracing violence. Based on current academic discussions as well as the results of the author\u2019s own research, the author concludes that the opponents of these ideas have serious counter\u2011 arguments. In their views, radicalization can be explained by a wide range of different factors. Violent and non\u2011violent Islamists compete for the audience, and therefore, not only can non\u2011violent Islamists embrace jihadist views but also, vice versa, some jihadists can change their position to non\u2011violence. Moreover, Muslim values, as well as those of the Islamists, are not necessarily antagonistic in all their aspects with the values of Western democracies. Various theoretical approaches form the basis for an alternative program of practical measures that could be implemented in the future."

The author compares three documents in which the parliamentary commission of the French Senate, the President, and the deputies of the National Assembly of France, respectively, presented their views on the problem. As the analysis shows, all three documents consider as a threat not only religiously motivated violence but also the very spread of radical ideology, which leads to the separation of certain Muslim communities from the rest of society and the promotion of social norms that contradict the \u201cvalues of the Republic\u201d. Both the deputies and President Macron proposed a package of measures, including increasing control over private schools and home education; strengthening the power of secret services and the prefects of departments (administrative regions); and banning foreign funding of religious organizations. The \u201crepublican values\u201d that the bill aims to protect become mandatory for both government employees and for non\u2011profit organizations applying for state subsidies. The paper then discusses the heated public debate over the new legislation."

The roundtable participants discussed different approaches referring to the results of their own observations and research. French policy was viewed from the pan\u2011European perspective as well as in terms of its correlation with the Russian experience."

First, it leads researchers to considering the regimes of secularity in Eastern Europe as variations of the \u201cSoviet model,\u201d which is false. Second, it entails inaccuracies in the analysis of the regime of secularity that has developed in post\u2011Soviet Russia that the authors propose to describe as \u201cpost\u2011atheistic.\u201d The special Russian case implied the destruction of the very mechanism of religious and cultural transmission during the period of communist rule. This is where other features of the post\u2011atheistic society stem from: a relatively low relevance of religious symbols and narratives for the social fabric; the involvement of religious agency in the projects of nation\u2011building and, there\u2011 fore, a predominantly ideological, rather than religious, motivation of the subjects of such agency; a top\u2011down, rather than bottom\u2011up, dynamic of the post\u2011Soviet return of religion to the public sphere; the lack of a broad public support of the state activities in this field; wide\u2011 spread polarization of views on the role of public religion in modern society \u2014 either linking religion to cultural backwardness, or the total rejection of modernity and secular culture."

The article argues that the notion of sacrum (as related to God), which directly correlated with the position of priest and defined its meaning until the 17th century, later, through the 18th century, was replaced by the notion of the community, in which the priest performs some cultic functions. The definitions of Enlightenment partly discredited the priestly power and position often representing them as dangerous for society and contradicting the civic duty of the priest. This shift is interpreted as reflecting the main changes in the modern worldview, when the hierarchical unity of social and cosmological orders was replaced by the functional understanding of society."

            "Abstract": "The article applies the Gnostic trope as the most suitable tool for analyzing religious components of contemporary mass culture. Christopher Partridge\u2019s theory of occulture serves as a methodological framework. The Gnostic trope includes the following elements: the idea that our world is a prison created for the torment of man; that it is controlled by the evil Creator of this world \u2014 the demiurge; that some exceptional persons, the Gnostics, are able to unravel the deceptive nature of reality and offer gnosis \u2014 a kind of extra\u2011rational experience. The way this trope functions is illustrated by examples of the writers such as L. Darell, F. Dick, and V. Pelevin; a rapper Oxymiron; the movies such as \u201cThe Matrix\u201d or \u201cThe Truman Show\u201d. The article offers an explanation of the popularity of the Gnostic trope. \u0421urrent global trends and the spread of digital culture led to general uncertainty and disorientation, and people feel imprisoned in a sort of panopticon, as described by Michel Foucault. The Gnostic trope means an attempt to personalize this impersonal power by identifying it with the demiurge."

            "Abstract": "The recognition of the contextual nature of Christian theology is a relatively new phenomenon that has challenged the understanding of Christianity as the universal, eternal and unchanging truth equally authoritative for all times and peoples. The recent shift in understanding of the nature of theology could be interpreted as a recognition of its ability to incorporate specific socio-cultural contexts in which it arises, as well as human experience with all its achievements, complications and uncertainties. In the article, the contextuality of theology is considered, firstly, as its ability to transform the universal truth of Christianity in conformity with particular social circumstances; secondly, as a theological response to specific social, political, economic, cultural, environmental, etc. problems and situations. The author explains the emergence of contextual theology; analyzes the missiological approach towards contextuality; the interdependence of theology and socio-political processes; presents the types of contextual theology: liberation, feminist, black, queer and other theologies. Controversies associated with contextual nature of theology are highlighted, including excessive circumstantiation and absolutization of otherhood, which complicates the dialogue between theologies that have arisen in different contexts. The conclusion which is drawn about the relationship between universality and particularity in contextual theology is that there are doctrinal claims shared by all Christians that transcend any specific socio-cultural context, and yet these claims negotiate dialectically with each context. Thus, universality of the Christian message arises from its ability to respond to any past, present or future specific human situation."

            "Pages": "",
            "Abstract": "The article is devoted to the rethinking of the traditional doctrine of creation in postmetaphysical theology, which is seen as an example of contextual theology. An analysis of the works of Catherine Keller (feminist theology) and John Caputo (theology of event) demonstrates that creation is reinterpreted in the context of attempts to\u00a0\u00a0overcome the power discourse and dissociate the idea of the divine from the idea of sovereignty. The creation, in this postmodern theopoetics, is understood not as a move from nothing into something, but rather as a transformation of darkness and depth. The concept of creation ex nihilo is related to Greek philosophical concepts of omnipotence, which reject the primordial chaos and the feminine in favor of a powerful patriarchal deity. In this context, Keller and Caputo transform the traditional doctrine of creation ex nihilo into creation ex profundis or ex amore. In their interpretation, the biblical narrative doesn\u2019t describe a single pure force acting ex nihilo, but an ensemble of forces, one of which appears as active and formative, and the other as more open, mobile and unformed. Thus, in postmodern theology, we have an emphasis on poetic becoming and the rejection of a hypermasculine, powerful God. We argue that theological hermeneutics, in its effort to destroy divine sovereignty, also deconstructs traditional monotheism. This theology tries to show that religion in the postmodern world is a way of being-in-the-world."

            "Abstract": "The article describes dark ecclesiology, a new theological theory of the church. According to the author, it represents a strategy of emancipation of the ecclesiastical thought and practice from clericocentrism. For centuries, ecclesiology focused on describing hierarchical structures that shaped normativity within the church. Everything strange and abnormal remained in the shadows. \u201cInvisible\u201d groups (women; queer people; unbaptized; human embryos; animals and other non-human living beings) fall into the shadow area and are excluded by the clerical authorities from the scope of ecclesiology. Dark ecclesiology allows for a fresh look at the church. As a theological research method, it reconsiders the church\u2019s composition, structure, and boundaries; it provides an opportunity to speak about earlier excluded church actors and things, avoiding their forced normalization within the framework of mainstream ecclesiological theories. The critical potential of dark ecclesiology makes it possible to reveal the contingency of church norms and the arbitrariness of the exclusion from the church of those who consider themselves to be church members. Shadow actors are described through theological infra-language, which is a way of correlating different perspectives and narratives in one space through which they express their belonging to the church. Dark ecclesiology refers to a flat ontology that asserts the ontological equality of all actors, including God. Methodologically, it uses the ideas of object-oriented philosophers (T. Morton, G. Harman, and others) and B. Latour\u2019s actor-network theory. In dark ecclesiology, in Latour\u2019s terms, the reassembly of the church community takes place."

            "Abstract": "The feminist theological and historical work of Elisabeth Sch\u00fcssler Fiorenza has been met with diverging responses. For feminist biblical scholars, Sch\u00fcssler Fiorenza is essential reading, with even her works from the 1970s and 1980s still standing as key reference points. For mainstream (\u201cmalestream\u201d) biblical scholarship, however, her entire body of writing is typically ignored, including within historical Jesus research (HJR), despite its value in both problematising and advancing the so-called Quests for the Historical Jesus. By evaluating and synthesising Sch\u00fcssler Fiorenza\u2019s HJR work on fundamentalism, feminism, and anti-Semitism, this article situates the effects of Sch\u00fcssler Fiorenza\u2019s work and the credibility of her critics within the Quests. While the themes Sch\u00fcssler Fiorenza addresses, such as feminism and Judaism, are key features of the Third Quest, her proposals with regard to HJR, including the politics of interpretation, the shift to memory and orality studies, and the evaluation of meaning-making itself, are theoretically critical and self-reflexive in a way which the Third Quest has rarely been. Given the emphasis Sch\u00fcssler Fiorenza places on self-evaluation, and her critical examination of the work of her peers in HJR, one is led to consider the possibility that her work may represent a Third Quest Critical-Stream, or even a Fourth Quest."

Cone also summoned White American Christians and the White church to embody the liberative message of the biblical prophets and Jesus Christ, as well as God\u2019s categorical demands to Christians to practice justice, do what is right, and to hate oppression. In the same vein, through his politico-theological and ethical writings, he awakened the American conscience to the forces and systems that oppress and dehumanize Black people and alienate other marginalized groups in America from the opportunities and privileges in society."

            "Abstract": "Although some theologians have been advocating for a thorough consideration of ecological issues for more than twenty years, it is only recently that it has become an important matter for some churches and for political theology. In a 1995 book, \u201cCry of the earth, cry of the poor,\u201d Leonardo Boff argued that together with social and justice concerns for the poor, the church and the society should look and respond to the destruction of the environment. Boff echoed the \u201cJustice, Peace and Integrity of Creation\u201d project led by the World Council of Churches. The climate crisis later became a locus theologicus but also a topic for national and international advocacy. It became an ecumenical and interfaith concern expressed through various initiatives. Pope Francis\u2019 encyclical Laudato si\u2019, 2015, catalyzed these reflections and actions and constituted a turning point in the social doctrine of the Catholic Church. The COVID-19 pandemic raised new ecological concerns. However, despite all these developments, most of the churches have not yet mainstreamed ecology in their discourse and their pastoral action."

In the Hebrew Bible the term s\u0101r\u00ees appears mainly as an element of the administrative apparatus. In the New Testament the image of the eunuch becomes the subject of theological reflection. In the Gospel of Matthew, Christ says that there are \u201cEunuchs who have made themselves Eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven\u201d (Matthew 19:12). The article examines this verse, its Sitz im Leben, and traces its influence on both Christian theology and the religious practice of the followers of Christ. For a long time, the eunuchs in Matthew 19:12 have been seen by commentators as a model of chastity, an ideal member of the Christian Church, a prototype of a monk. However, the analysis of ancient texts shows how morally ambiguous the image of the eunuch was. In the ancient Mediterranean, the eunuch was the epitome of transgression of all norms related to family and sexual life. Through this image, everything that seemed eternal and reasonable was called into question. Hence, the image of eunuch given as a positive ideal denied the triumphant heterosexual binary model in which such things as family, gender, and gender identity were inscribed."

Rash\u012bd al-D\u012bn\u2019s informant was the Buddhist monk Kam\u0101lashr\u012b from Kashmir. These references are found in several passages of the \u201cHistory of India\u201d: at the beginning and the end of this book as well as at the beginning of the section about Buddhism. The Buddha is presented in that part as the latest \u201cProphet\u201d in a series of other \u201cProphets\u201d (past Buddhas of earlier ages) who established the \u201cSunna\u201d for his followers, and his words constituted the \u201cScriptures\u201d\u2014 the Abhidharma. Karl Jahn and Johan Elverskog interpreted this as Islamization of the discourse, and Johan Elverskog explicitly denied that the Abhidharma could be called the \u201cScriptures of the Buddha\u201d or his \u201crevelation\u201d. The present article shows this to be wrong. It is well known that Buddhist sources claim that the Fourth Buddhist Council was held in Kashmir in the reign of King Kanishka, and the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins declared the Abhidharma-pi\u1e6daka as \u201cthe words of the Buddha\u201d (buddhavacana) in polemics with the S\u016btrav\u0101dins (Sautr\u0101ntika). A similar veneration of the third part of the Buddhist Canon (Abhidhamma) is also witnessed to in Pali sources."

            "Abstract": "The article analyzes the process of post-Soviet invention of a new religious tradition of icon painting in the Armenian Apostolic Church. During the Middle Ages, the Armenian Christianity did not produce a tradition of icon-worshipping. However, since the 17th century, due to various reasons, church painting was developed and became a part of both church interior and everyday religiosity. During the Church's post-Soviet re-institutionalization, such painting became more and more demanded as its purchase and gifting was a significant part of the church economy and of prestigious gift exchange. As a result, along with the wide-known older \u201c Armenian\u201d style, a new \u201c icon painting canon\u201d emerged. It was \u201c reconstructed\u201d, but in fact invented, as an allegedly authentic Armenian style, on the basis of Byzantine icons and the medieval Armenian book miniature, by two icon-painters, father and son Azaryans. Azaryans claimed primacy of the Armenian icon-painting by referring to the evangelical myth of the miraculous image of Christ, allegedly belonging to the Armenian king Abgar. Although the Azaryans\u2019 project remains marginal and feminized, it may be seen as a manifestation of post-secular religiosity, a form of religious practice and even an act of religious conversion."

This strategy includes a wide range of practices widespread in Christian traditions \u2014 from contact techniques of communicating with relics ( touching, wearing on the body, eating/drinking a fragment, etc.) to distant practices (approximation, eye contact, directing the relic at the desired person, object or locus, etc.). These are manipulative practices targeted at using the virtue that is supposed to emanate from a sacred object for necessary purposes \u2014 from healing, protecting, attacking the enemy, to creating new contact relics and spreading the virtue in various material objects. As the author shows, such practices are grounded in the idea that sacred objects have a \u201csecond body\u201d, the invisible virtue extended in space around an icon, relics or brandea. Contact with this \u201cbody\u201d is believed to be highly effective; it is achieved through various ways of \u201c distant touch\u201d. The idea of the shrine as a permanent source of virtue that can be used, appropriated with the help of certain physical operations, laid ground for many actions that have been performed in various Christian traditions until now."

It transformed the ordinary objects ( often instruments of torture and murder) that touched the bodies of saints into relics, the symbol and medium of their presence in this world. What is even more important, the objects that later touched the relics were believed to become secondary (or contact) relics that could respond to the aspirations of pilgrims. Through the liquid that was used to wash a reliquary or some engraving that was applied to a miraculous fresco, the Christians could partake in the salutary/healing power of the saints. Towards the late Middle Ages in Catholic Europe, along with the ancient tactile rituals, a new set of practices appeared, which relied on the touch of the gaze. This article deals with pilgrim mirrors as an instrument for appropriation of the sacred virtus and to other practices that relied on the power of sight."

The paper analyzes the circumstances of the search and acquisition of the relics of Jean of Ghent, the role of the Royal Court in this process, its relations with the monastic community of Troyes, where Jean was buried, as well as with the Roman Curia and Pope Sixtus IV (1471\u20131484). The process of gaining relics and their subsequent fate were central in the negotiations of the French throne with the Pope, as they were seen in the late Middle Ages as one of the main evidences of the holiness of a candidate for canonization. The paper analyzes the correspondence of Louis XI with the monks of Troyes and with the papal Curia; the Liber miraculorum of Jean of Ghent; and the materials of the routine process for his canonization. Based on these sources, the paper shows, what the relics of a saint meant for the French of the late 15th century; how the relics\u2019 authenticity was determined; and what were the ways of using the relics by secular authorities and various groups of the medieval society."

            "Abstract": "For the persecuted English Catholic community, the preservation of the relics of pre-Reformation saints, as well as acquisition of the relics of new martyrs, required cooperation between clergy and Catholic laity. At the same time, the English Catholic hierarchy had no coercive power in the post-Reformation period: unlike officially Catholic countries, English Catholic clergy could not control the cults of the new martyrs. As a result, a number of narratives was produced to describe relics and the \u201ccorrect\u201d forms of the veneration of saints, but these texts rather reflect a desirable, than the real situation. The articleis focused on the early 17th-century texts linked to the so-called \u201cFather Garnet\u2019s straw\u201d (1606): a relic acquired at the execution of the Jesuit Henry Garnet, who was sentenced to death for his presumed involvement in the Gunpowder plot. Immediately after the execution, stories emerged about a straw allegedly imbued with the martyr\u2019s blood. An image of Father Garnet \u2014 his face under the crown of martyrdom \u2014 was discovered on the straw, and it was proclaimed to have thaumaturgical powers. The analysis of pamphlets, the examination of persons involved, and the texts produced by the Jesuits reveal discrepancies between the ideal model of interaction between believers and the relics, which was promoted by the Catholic clergy and implied a minimum of physical contact, and common manipulative practices used by lay Catholics."

The miniatures are accompanied by prayers necessary to obtain indulgences and protection from diseases and dangers, including those at childbirth that in the Middle Ages often led to the death of mother and/or baby. The \u201cbirth girdles\u201d are a variation of the so-called Arma Christi (Instruments of the Passion of Christ) manuscripts dating back to the 14th century. They are essential for understanding how piety and magic intersected in the daily lives of medieval people. A study of the texts and iconography of the Beinecke MS 410 suggests that the early owners of the scroll used various types of contact with images \u2014 tactile, visual, oral, and audial \u2014 to gain divine protection and patronage. The iconography of the Christ Child with Cross miniature and its place in the general visual-textual program of the scroll show that it was added to the manuscript for pregnant women and women in labor, as a special addition to the already existing set of protective images. The child in the miniature is the patron of both women and of the healthy child. An analysis of the iconography of the miniatures and their relationship to the text allows us to understand how religious images acted as amulets for women in labor and pregnant women, helping them cope with fear and uncertainty."

The paper analyzes three well-known replicas of the Virgin\u2019s icons \u201c with the legend\u201d created and revered in the last decades of the 17th \u2014 early 18th centuries (\u201cOur Lady of Vladimir\u201d by Cyril Ulanov, \u201cTheodor\u2019s Our Lady\u201d by Gury Nikitin, and \u201cOur Lady of Tikhvin\u201d by an unknown artist). In these works, the wonders of ancient shrines depicted in the chapters of their frames referred to significant events of the Russian history. Problems of decoding the iconographic programs of these icons, interpreting their plots, revealing the artistic techniques of transmitting the power of their miraculous prototypes are studied within a wide cultural and historical context. The icons emphasized those miracles that fit into the concept of a genetic connection of the Romanov dynasty with Vladimir-Suzdal and Moscow Russian state. The power of the miraculous icons of the Virgin Mary was not only appropriated in new images in the hope of receiving miraculous help from these replicas; the new icons were intended to preserve the memory of the miracles performed by the original images that saved Russian troops and cities in various dangerous situations."

The cross, according to a legend, was revealed in 1423 to shepherds who saw him descending from the sky. According to the official version, the cross is of Byzantine origin and it appeared in Russia as a sign of the transition of spiritual grace from Constantinople to Moscow. A church was erected at the site where the cross has been revealed, then demolished in 1940, and the cross was transferred to the temple of a neighboring village, where it has been kept until today. In the 1990s, a monastery was built on the site of the cross discovery. The monastery declared its rights to possessing the cross. As a result, a confrontation between the two religious centers led to \u201cdoubling of the sacred\u201d and conflicting claims for the appropriation of sacred power, understood as an emanation of the sacred power of the original Life-Giving Cross of the Lord. The cross and its copies keep a symbolic meaning of the Russian state building. The article draws upon official publications and field data."

These relics have given rise to many explanations and provoked various practices. Starting with the first widely publicized case \u2014 the imprint of the Kiev icon of Mother of God \u201c Prizri na smirenie\u201d that was found in 1993, examined and officially proclaimed a miracle by the Ukranian Orthodox Church \u2014 such images began to be found and described in many churches in Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, the Baltic States, and Israel. The idea that these imprints are the acheiropoietos, \u201cnot-made-by-hands\u201d images, brings the tradition in a broader context of local veneration of images found on various natural or urban objects (trees, walls, window glass, etc.). The imprints on icon-cases are most important and widespread objects of that kind, often venerated officially by clerics in churches and monasteries. These images are closely related to icons, and their appearance is often interpreted as the result of the influence of the invisible virtue that goes from an icon and reflects on the glass. The article discusses various assessments of this phenomenon and ways of venerating such imprints and their \u201cmother\u201d icons."

The studied practices are divided into four groups: 1) practices of political non-participation ( abstaining from participating in elections, joining public organizations, signing Soviet documents); 2) religious practices (refusal to attend an official church; meetings of believers at home; home prayer and sermon); 3) economic practices (rejecting wages, state loans, pensions and social payments; non-paying taxes); 4) labor practices (refusal to join collective farms, state farms and work at Soviet enterprises).

The article is primarily based on papal encyclicals, statements and letters. The research reveals that for decades European integration has been under the close attention of the Holy See and was perceived primarily as an opportunity to strengthen the position of the Roman Catholic Church in Europe. At the same time, the attempts of the Holy See to include priority issues (first of all, \u201cChristian roots\u201d as Europe\u2019s ideological and moral basis) in the fundamental documents of the EU were unsuccessful. As a result, the Holy See has shifted its interest from the European continent to Latin America, Africa and Asia. Despite this shift, the study shows that the Vatican and the EU are conducting a full-fledged dialogue in areas that represent mutual interest."

The idea is to represent the voices of women, who performed the Hijra to IS, through the analysis of their personal narratives. The study is based upon interviews with forty women who were returned from Syria and Iraq with the humanitarian operation Zhusan. The case of female emigration to the territory of the \u201cIslamic State\u201d is presented against the background of the process of formation of various types of female identity and problematic issues of the development of the Kazakhstani ummah. The compiled social profiles of women refute their stereotypical portrayal as people with a low level of secular education, low income and lack of agency. The dominant discourse in women\u2019s narratives is a break with the previous secular life, the rejection of old religious patterns in favour of a new community \u2014 a female jamaat \u2014 based on the idea of \u201cpure\u201d Islam. The main factors of the Hijra were: identity crisis and religious quest; striving to find social support in a new community; romantic relationships; insufficient development of religious education for women; socio-economic deprivation; ISIS propaganda."

Drawing on the research lens of the medievalist Debra Higgs Strickland, Maizuls examines specific archetypes of hostile otherness projected by Western Christians onto the images of the Antichrist. The author sees the key to the Adoration of the Magi in the face of the Magi in a red mantle, for he is perceived \u201cas the antichrist/Jewish Messiah.\u201d The basis for the advancement of the Jew-Antichrist concept was the crystallization by the 13th century of the stereotypical iconographic form of the Jew, which made no difference between the biblical Jews, who crucified Jesus, and the Jews of the Middle Ages. In the end, the researcher comes to the conclusion that Bosch was one of the first artists, who put the semantic center of his triptychs\u2019 central parts not so much on the image of the New Testament collision as such, but rather on the drama of human life, on a person who found himself between Christ and Antichrist."

I argue that contemporary arguments from evil go back to the discussions of the origin of evil and its place in the general order of things, as well as to the dual classification of good and evil (good-evil-indifferent and soul-body-external good/evil) in Antiquity. However, a hallmark of the contemporary version of the problem of evil is that it is formulated exclusively as atheistic arguments (i.e. arguments a gainst God\u2019s existence). All these arguments are sound only within the context of Abrahamic religions so that they constitute argumentative problem only for theism. One of the main trends in the development of these debates is to overcome established theistic practices of theodicy and defences."

However, there is also a metaethical (or \u201caxiological\u201d) formulation of the problem. The article considers the so-called privation theory of evil, one of the most ancient responses to the argument from evil. First, I consider the metaethical formulation of the problem. Secondly, I consider the privation theory of evil as it is presented in the writings of Augustine of Hippo and Thomas Aquinas. I show that the concept of \u201corder\u201d (ordo) is one of the main elements of theirtreatments of the privatio boni theory, and it is complemented by the common Western theological idea of two types of evil \u2014 sin (peccatum) and punishment for sin (poena peccati) in the case of Augustine, and evil of punishment (malum poenae) and evil of guilt (malum culpae) in the case of Aquinas. In the third part I turn to the metaethical presuppositions of the privatio boni theory. I argue that in moral ontology, this theory is most compatible with moral realism; in moral epistemology, it goes with cognitivism and epistemological foundationalism; and in moral psychology, it works with one of the versions of motivational internalism."

Nevertheless, the \u201cnaturalistic fallacy\u201d implies the fact that there is a crisis of basic notions in modern culture. The task of this article is to consider the crisis and to try finding the way out. The author associates this solution with the theory of transcendentalia."

            "Abstract": "In the traditional sense, the existence of postmortem life in form of heaven and hell, seen as reward or punishment, seems to be a necessary condition of divine justice. Contemporary analytic theology and philosophy of religion question this account of posthumous retribution. A particular target of criticism is the doctrine of \u201ceternal hell\u201d, since for many people eternal torments appear to be incompatible with divine goodness. This article examines the arguments of the known analytic theologian Thomas Talbott against the compatibility of \u201ceternal hell\u201d with God\u2019s unconditional love for all men. Talbott\u2019s arguments are based on the concept of love, according to which love is deemed of as an individual attitude, while the understanding of love as a substance does not lead to a contradiction between the existence of eternal hell and the unconditional divine love for all people. The argument of David Lewis asserting the amorality of God\u2019s creating the world that includes an eternal hell is also examined. It is shown that the response to this argument, given by the contemporary Thomist John Lamont, convincingly demonstrates that it is based on premises which supporters of the traditional doctrine of eternal hell are not obliged to accept."

            "Abstract": "This paper examines the problem of practical and social significance of the belief in free will on the example of Derk Pereboom\u2019s theory of hard incompatibilism. First, I present the general elements of hard incompatibilism focusing on its positive aspects that involve a forwardlooking approach to moral responsibility and a proposal to replace a number of allegedly destructive reactive attitudes with less damaging and more constructive ones. Second, I elaborate and discuss the general logic of moral justification that, as I argue, underlies Pereboom\u2019s approach. I further argue that this logic entails the irrelevance of the belief in free will for moral justification of social practices. Third, I outline the main features of the problem of hell in order to show that hell could not be morally justified in Pereboom\u2019s logic of moral justification. Then I show that the idea of hell provides a unique example where the belief in libertarian free will plays a crucial role in the structure of moral justification. On this basis, I argue that while the belief in free will is mostly irrelevant for the justification of social practices, it might play a crucial role in the justifications of religious practices that involve the belief in hell."

            "Abstract": "The author considers the argument formulated by a number of modern philosophers (G. Oppy, P. Draper) that atheism has a certain heuristic advantage in explaining the phenomenon of evil, which in discussions between theism and naturalism allows us to justify the rational choice of a theoretical position in favor of naturalism. The author admits the peripheral nature of the problem of evil in non-theistic thinking, while he shows a major trend in current philosophy to conceptualize the problem of evil within the framework of secular thinking. The author indicates a process underway of forming of a separate subject area, a kind of secular \u201cevil studies,\u201d the potential and productivity of which is too early to assess. The paper then explores the assumption that the description of the mechanics of work of evil can be identical with its explanation. The opinion that evil is exclusively problematized in theistic thinking is but a result of a certain inertia of the intellectual history. In fact, the problem of evil is one of the vulnerable points within atheistic (and, broadly, secular) discourse, which downplays the alleged heuristic advantage of atheism."

            "Abstract": "This article deals with the problem of morality in the ethical system of Kant and historical transformation of his ethical ideas. At the first stage, we show the prerequisites of the problem. At the second stage, we explore the place of this problem in Kant\u2019s ethical system and the method of solving it. Kant\u2019s assertion of religious postulates is thought of as a specific way of justifying morality. At the third stage, we propose a reconstruction of the historical fate of the doctrine of postulates,\u00a0\u00a0in particular, its refraction in the thought of Nietzsche and Dostoevsky. The analysis allows to establish the significance of religious postulates as a necessary part of Kant\u2019s ethical system that protects morality from devaluation; and to reconstruct the logic of the transition from Kant\u2019s ethical system to the ideas of Nietzsche and Dostoevsky. Kantian religious postulates, on the one hand, ensure the unity and integrity of moral experience, but, on the other hand, they contradict to the logic of the modern thinking. The transition from Kant\u2019s ethical absolutism to the radical doubt in morality in the thought of Dostoevsky and Nietzsche seem to have been inevitable. The author concludes that the solution of problem of the justification of morality cannot be found within the framework of the modern philosophical thought."

The article demonstrates the foundations of the antitheodicy and offers identification of the existential dimension of the problem of evil within the framework of religious life, expressed in the concept of \u201ctheological relational trauma\u201d. From this perspective, the existential root of the problem of evil within the religious life consists in the discovery of the inability of an individual to love God. The author demonstrates how theoretical reflection on the problem of evil depends on the existential experience. The article also offers two solutions to the problem of evil, which are based on what can be characterized, under certain assumptions, as mystical experience. The author highlights the phenomenological properties of this mystical experience and demonstrates that it provides a solution to the existential problem of evil in the spirit of antitheodicy."

            "Abstract": "An increasing number of Orthodox Christians are turning to methods of assisted reproduction. However, the ambivalent position of the \u201cBasis of the Social Concept of the Russian Orthodox Church\u201d (2000) does not give believers clear ethical guidelines as to which reproductive methods are acceptable. In addition, the one-sided interpretation of the \u201cBasis\u201d led to a complete rejection of in vitro fertilization (IVF). The Church's commission \u201cIntercouncil Presence\u201d has developed a draft document that aims to clarify the ambiguous position of the \u201cBasis\u201d regarding reproductive technologies. In February 2021, the draft document, \u201cEthical issues related to in vitro fertilization,\u201d was published on the Church\u2019s official website. This paper analyzes the discussions that took place both before and after the publication. The author shows that IVF opponents do not understand the problem under discussion, using irrelevant, selective data that do not reflect the real state of medical practice to confirm their arguments. Analyzing the objections, the author shows that the death of embryos during IVF occurs due to natural causes, and therefore cannot be equated with murder. It is also argued that the level of congenital pathology in children remains at the level of a fraction of a percent and therefore cannot make IVF ethically unacceptable. Also, the article challenges concerns about the harm that IVF causes to pregnant women. Besides, the article reflects publications showing the possibility of the practical application of the published draft document."

            "Abstract": "The authors examine the tradition of appeals to foreign religious leaders, primarily to the Pope, by the believers, mostly Orthodox, from the Soviet Union. The practice of appealing to the Pope for help goes back to the time of Civil War and went on through the entire Soviet period. In the late 1910s\u20131920s, the authors of such appeals were mainly Orthodox hierarchs. In the early 1930s, this practice became more widespread, and after World War II it was mostly continued by the activists and dissident groups. The reason for this tradition was the belief that pressure from Western religious and political leaders could force the Soviet leadership to change its policy of persecuting believers. In 1923, this belief took shape in a kind of \u201cCurzon Ultimatum syndrome\u201d, since it was with the appearance of this memorandum of the British government that believers associated the release of Patriarch Tikhon from arrest. The tradition was grounded on the belief that pressure from Western religious and political leaders could force the Soviet authorities to change its policy of religious persecutions. The effectiveness of such appeals to the Vatican for the pre-war period was highly questionable, while appeals by activists and dissident groups in the 1960-1980s proved to be quite efficient. A number of circumstances contributed to the fact that the Pope became, in fact, the main (although not the only) recipient of such letters: the Pope was one of the main moral leaders of the Western religious world; the Soviet counter-propaganda campaign against Vatican made the Pope a recognizable image in Soviet mass consciousness. In the Cold War context, the appeal to such a significant figure became one of theways for religious dissidents to make themselves and their concepts visible and to join the international campaign for the protection of human rights, in which the Vatican was actively involved."

            "Abstract": "The concept of duhovnoe (\u201cspiritual\u201d) is widely used in contemporary Russian socio-political discourse. Concepts like \u201cspiritual values\u201d and \u201cspiritual culture\u201d are used at the official level, even in legislative documents, while \u201cbeing spiritual\u201d for many Russians is associated with the richness of the inner world and personal potential. At the same time, the lexicon associated with the history of the Russian Orthodox Church has preserved a specific institutional understanding of \u201cspiritual\u201d, in such expressions as dukhovnaia seminaria (theological seminary), dukhovnoe soslovie (\u201cecclesiastical estate\u201d) or dukhovenstvo (\u201cclergy\u201d). This article undertakes the reconstruction of the concept of \u201cspiritual\u201d as it developed in the early modern period, from the second half of the 17th until the first half of the 19th century. It shows the formation of an \u201cinstitutional\u201d understanding of the \u201cspiritual,\u201d initiated by the modern state. At the same time, the archaic category of the \u201cspiritual\u201d has being developed within the framework of the ascetic church discourse, where the \u201cspiritual\u201d is placed in opposition to the \u201csecular\u201d, in a response to the formation of secular culture. In turn, within the framework of secular culture as such, the spiritual was reformulated under the impact of the Western mystical tradition, meaning an individual relation to God. Finally, some members of the clergy forged their own idea of \u201ctruly spiritual,\u201d paradoxically inspired by the secular discourse."

The diversity of the Evangelical field in Chile demands a thorough review of Evangelicals\u2019 interaction with politics and society. Our results show that Evangelicals and Pentecostals, compared to the Catholic population, have higher involvement in voluntary associations and lower interest in politics. Evangelicals expect their religious authorities to play an active role in the political field while overall, en masse, they are less involved in politics and less concerned in defining their political identity than their Catholic compatriots. This finding, to some extent, goes against the theory of social capital, which assumes that involvement in religious activities results in increased civic participation in general. Data for the study come from a national sample of Evangelicals (n=754)."

Authors reconstruct Haidt\u2019s intention of reinterpreting and possibly overcoming the ever growing \u201cculture wars\u201d in American society \u2014 the difference between liberals and conservatives in their understanding of what constitutes the basic set of moral foundations. The opposition between intuitionist (Hume) and rationalistic (Kant) approaches to morality in social psychology is considered, followed by the discussion of the complex relationship between biological, evolutionist and sociocultural mechanisms according to Haidt, as well as his original revision of the theory of \u201chomo duplex\u201d by Emile Durkheim, who understood collective identity in terms of the sacred bonds. In the final part of the article authors show that the most vulnerable arguments of Haidt are not those related to the \u201cbiological reductionism\u201d often erroneously attributed to the American thinker, but issues related to the insufficient elaboration of the criteria of the identification of the five or six specific foundations, and to self-contradictory character of the strategic move of the book: Haidt tries to extend the too narrow spectrum of the moral foundations of his liberal colleagues and compatriots by the force of his rational arguments, but at the same time he shows that moral reactions are rather intuitive and not rational by nature."

            "Abstract": "The article discusses the emergence of Tibetan nationalism in Sino-Tibetan borderland in the period after the fall of the Qing Empire in 1911 and untill the incorporation of Tibet into the PRC in 1951. It argues that the cult of the Bodhisattva of compassion Avalokite\u015bvara was a key spiritual root of the Tibetan religious nationalism, associating Tibet with the state of the Dalai Lamas. Other kinds of nationalisms emerged on the vast territory of the Tibetan plateau, among which the author distinguishes Tibetan collaborative nationalism and secular autonomist nationalism of Kuomintang or Communist types. The religious factor was central in this competition. Tibetan Buddhism, due to its long tradition of interweaving religion and politics, easily adapted to new conditions and was used by various forms of nationalism for diametrically opposite aims. The article shows how the clash of various national and religious interests finally led to the victory of the Chinese communists and the defeat of the religious nationalism. The author argues that the cult of Avalokite\u015bvara, despite the defeat of the religious nationalism in 1951, became the \u201cicon\u201d of Tibetan nationalism of the subsequent period associated with the exodus of Tibetans to India in 1959."

The author highlights both internal sociocultural and religious interest within the Russian intelligentsia, and the interest to cultures of India, Tibet and China in the context of the political events of the time. The author shows how the perception of Buddhism was influenced by the Orthodox mission and theology, the growth of Oriental studies, the formation of the intelligentsia and of the national elites, as well as the appropriation of Oriental material in Russian philosophy and literature. The author analyzes the phenomenon of \u201cRussian Asiaphiles;\u201d the ideas of Prince Esper Ukhtomsky, a representative of \u201cvostochnichestvo\u201d (Russian Orientalism); the studies of a brilliant galaxy of academic Orientalists from the school of Fyodor Shcherbatsky; works by esoteric thinkers like Elena Blavatsky, Nikolai and Elena Roerich; authors like Ivan Bunin, Konstantin Balmont, Innokenty Annensky and others. The article shows that a specific image of Buddhism, within the context of intercultural interaction, was created both by the interest for the \u201c other\u201d as different and, at the same time, as something that can possess a typological similarity."

            "Abstract": "The current development of Buddhism in Buryatia is often characterized by the term \u201crevival\u201d. The leadership of Buriat Buddhists, Pandito Khambo Lama Damba Ayusheev and his circle, played the central role in the ideological construction of this revived tradition. The activities of the \u201cBuddhist Traditional Sangha of Russia\u201d (BTSR) are not limited to the religious sphere and cover a variety of aspects of the socio-political and economic life of Buryatia. BTSR is often opposed by other Buddhist organizations and groups. This opposition, or competition, forces BTSR to make significant efforts to integrate the \u201ctraditional\u201d Buddhist community. This paper identifies the basic elements of constructing the Buddhist \u201crevival\u201d in Buryatia through the analysis of the activities of the Buddhist leadership. The leitmotif of the revival/ invention of the tradition is the claim of historical continuity and defining clear ethnic boundaries of the Buryat Buddhist community and its ability to overcome marginality within Russia and within the Buddhist community worldwide. Another element of this struggle for legitimacy is sacralization of the Buryat territory by introducing specific Buddhist markers. The most significant of such markers was the so-called \u201crecovery of the immortal body of the Lama Itigelov.\u201d This created a basis for supporting prestige and legitimacy of Buryat Buddhism and its claims to the status of an important Buddhist center in Russia and worldwide."

            "Abstract": "The article considers Buddhism in modern Mongolia in the context of the world of Tibetan Buddhism. The peculiarity of Buddhism in modern Mongolia lies in the simultaneous coexistence of different models and interpretations of Buddhism. The \u201csocialist\u201d model is the result of the transformations during the period of the People\u2019s Republic of Mongolia: Buddhism is seen as a part of the cultural and national heritage, and the Hambo-lama is recognized as head of the Sangha. The \u201cTibetan\u201d model assumes orientation to the Dalai Lama and those lamas who are close to him and calls for the restoration of the Tulku institution headed by Bogd Gegeen. Supporters of the \u201cnationalist\u201d model oppose the interference of the Tibetans altogether. Some lamas also defend the originality of Mongolian Buddhism. The emergence of the tenth Bogd Gegeen could potentially unite these disparate groups and significantly strengthen Mongolia\u2019s position in the world of Tibetan Buddhism that now undergoes through difficult times. Despite the economic difficulties, \u201cspiritual\u201d dependence on the Tibetan lamas and the tight pressure from China, it is in the field of Buddhism that the Mongols manage to show their agency and act as an independent player. Alternative religious discourses presented by followers of shamanism and Christianity are much less efficient or popular. The article draws upon extensive field sources."

            "Abstract": "The article looks at the Social Flock (sotsial\u2019naia otara) project whereby the sangha gives sheep to laypeople and other locals as a kind of socially engaged Buddhism in Buryatia. It places the Social Flock project into a broader context of moral economy in the region, where through various acts of help, support and other kinds of giving the sangha establishes itself as a \u201cpillar\u201d of society. The article also critically discusses the very concept of socially engaged Buddhism. While it is often understood in the literature as a distinctly novel kind of movement that takes on particular institutional forms, the article explores it instead as a more general ongoing negotiation of the religious realm, which has in fact been present and relevant throughout Buddhist history. Finally, it explores the implications of religious social engagement for contemporary \u201csecular\u201d modernity in Russia and the post-Soviet region more generally."

            "Abstract": "of Ak-Jang (White Faith or Burkhanism), an ethno-religious movement that sprang up in the Mountain Altai in the early twentieth century. It is emphasized that a large part of the \u201cWhite Faith\u201d pantheon and spiritual practices originated from Tibetan Buddhism that was coming from Mongolia. The article is particularly focused on the links between the messianism of the White Faith and ethno-religious messianic movement Amursana that developed in Western Mongolia from 1910 to 1923. Both movements received their spiritual and cultural inspiration both from Tibetan Buddhism and the shared set of heroic oral tales about the coming of the glorious redeemer prince Oirot (Amursana). Scholars frequently approached the Altaian \u201cWhite Faith\u201d movement as a purely local phenomenon stripped of significant neighboring political and spiritual influences. The goal of the present article is to expand the revisionist scholarship that questions that narrow approach. It is argued that the rapid expansion of Tibetan Buddhism into the Altai and the rise of the Ak-Jang messianic movement became possible as a result of the spiritual and political void created by Russia\u2019s defeat in the Russo-Japanese War and the eventual collapse of the Manchu and Russian empires. The article is based on the wide range of primary sources."

            "Abstract": "The article is devoted to pilgrimage and represents an anthropological interview with the researcher\u2019s comments. The interview was recorded on April 2019, in Elista, at the religious community of the Temple \u201cGolden Abode of Shakyamuni Buddha\u201d. The narrative shows how a pilgrimage to India is perceived by Kalmykia\u2019s believers as a means of coping with life\u2019s hurdles and of searching for its new meaning. A biographical interview illustrates the path to faith \u2014 from atheism, through ritual practices in the temple and reading Buddhist literature \u2014 to pilgrimage to Dharamsala and \u201ctaking refuge\u201d (conversion). The respondent presents her biography using a religious language that is new for her \u2014 the interview is rich with Buddhist terms. The story of the pilgrimage shows one\u2019s path to faith, in which everything goes in an extraordinary way, and the key word in this narrative is \u201cmiracle\u201d which is a tool of verifying faith. In the (post)secular context, belief in miracles is an element of the imagined border that distinguishes practicing, believing Buddhists from those who perceive Buddhism as a cultural tradition only. Another border marker of the pilgrim\u2019s habitus is daily practices: morning and evening prayers with beads, stretches, self-control over speech and behavior."

            "Abstract": "Since Christian theology, in order to formulate the articles of faith, inevitably uses the categorical apparatus of historically established philosophical traditions, the problem of theological languages is objectively present. This problem is primarily connected with the revealing of a correct correlation between those languages, which is required for maintaining the unity of the Holy Tradition. The issue in question had obtained a special significance for the Russian theological tradition of the 19th and 20th centuries, due to a fundamental paradigm shift in philosophy in the modern era and under the rapid development of Russian religious philosophy. Father Sergius Bulgakov, in particular intended to illustrate that the basic Christian dogmas, which still had not had an adequate exposition, could only be explained in the \u201c language of Sophiology\u201d. The present article analyzes the critique of the historical languages of theology, which was presented by Fr. Sergius in his so-called \u201cThe big trilogy\u201d that includes his last three large works (\u201cThe Lamb of God\u201d, \u201cThe Comforter\u201d, \u201cBride of the Lamb\u201d), it also reveals the peculiarities of the sophiological language of his own. Finally, based on the undertaken analysis, the article suggests a conceptual characterization of the \u201clanguage of Sophiology\u201d, as well as a conclusion about the association between Fr. Sergius\u2019 theological intentions and Russian \u201cNew Theology\u201d of the early 20th century."

            "Abstract": "The article analyzes one of the most controversial clashes over religion in India, namely the conflict around the worship of god Ayyappa in the \u015aabarimala temple in Kerala. The practice of preventing fertile women from entering the temple has been established and entrenched here, fertility being formally defined as the age between ten and fifty. The practice is due to the fact that Ayyappa in this temple is worshiped as brahmachari, \u201ceternal virgin.\u201d However, within the framework of the same Ayyappa cult in Kerala and partly elsewhere in South India, there are other images of this god, other interpretations and practices that allow women of any age to visit the shrines. In September 2018, the Indian Supreme Court ruled the ban for fertile women to be discriminatory. Since October 2018, Kerala has been engulfed in waves of protests, clashes between supporters and opponents of the gender restrictions, which sometimes turn into violent clashes. This paper analyzes the course of these events in the context of both Ayyappa cult and the current challenges of the regulation of religion in India."

Religion and politics were tightly interwoven in Russia\u2019s diplomatic activities there. Our analysis is made at the micro level, through the official correspondence of a Russian diplomat, Michail Nikolsky, who in the early 20th century served as a secretary of the Russian Imperial Consulate in Jeddah, Hejaz. The article also seeks to examine the influence of the human factor, sometimes wrongfully ignored, but always retaining a powerful presence in real politics. The recent developments indicate that even in the hyper-globalization era, despite the triumph of systemic institutions, the personification of policy remains a phenomenon of a planetary magnitude. The approach followed by the author in this article is akin, to a certain extent, to some anthropological models of historical research and can be also categorized as a kind of political anthropology. The tasks and goals of the Russian diplomacy are determined as a result of close scrutiny of the perused archival documents from the Foreign Policy Archive of the Russian Empire of the period of the First Russian Revolution of 1905\u20131907. Many of these documents are unedited. They tend to evoke the sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu reminding the Soviet/Russian foreign policy efforts undertaken in Hejaz/ Saudi Arabia during the Soviet and post-Soviet time."

            "Abstract": "Traditionally Aquinas is considered as the leading representative of the position that natural theology is the king road to the knowledge of God by means of human reason alone. Nevertheless, Alvin Plantinga cites him along with John Calvin among the two main predecessors of his famous idea of sensus divinitatis. According to this idea, human reason can have natural knowledge of God via special cognitive mechasnism, which is closer to the functioning of human perception, than to the proofs along the line of traditional theologia naturalis. The goal of the article is to identify whether one can really find in the work of Aquinas anything similar to the sensus divinitatis of Plantinga. And if the answer is positive, then how exactly does this epistemic mechanism perform the function of rational justification of theistic beliefs? As a result, I claim that in Aquinas one can really find something that could be called sensus divinitatis, but its justificatory work functions in a way that is quite different from that of Plantinga, because it involves the natural orientation of the human will to God as the ultimate goal of human life."

The conference was attended by more than 30 scholars from various academic centers of Russia, Belarus, Latvia, Poland and the USA. The discussion focused on a wide range of issues related to the evolution of Orthodoxy ( from governance structure to religious practices) under the influence of the modernization of Russian society at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries and the socio-political processes introduced by the revolutions and the formation of the Soviet system. The changes that took place then largely impact today\u2019s Russian Orthodoxy."

The overview gives a comparative analysis of these approaches considering the relation between the genesis and conceptual frame of each approach and the scope and boundaries of its application. Firstly, we focus on the difference in the conceptualization of the relation of media and religion. The theory of mediatization emphasizes the transformation of religion by media, the theory of mediation studies media as a part of religious practices, and RSST is concerned with shaping of media technologies by religious communities. Secondly, we outline that the discussed approaches differ in their interpretations of religion, which is crucial in defining the level of the analysis. While the conceptual frameworks of institutional tradition of mediatization theory and RSST address the institutionalized forms of religions, other approaches are suitable for the study of religious institutions as well as individual \u201clived religion\u201d. The general optic, the scope and the boundary of each approach is defined by the way religion is related to the media, and by the level of analysis."

While the first type corresponds in part to organized religion and may serve to project religious narratives into the public realm, the other two forms are driven primarily by various media considerations. Because of the mediatization of religion, he argues, \u201creligious media\u201d play only a marginal role in the construction of the public image of religion. \u201cJournal\u2011 ism on religion\u201d and \u201cbanal religion\u201d may stimulate criticism of the religious institutions and produce more individualized and more bricolage\u2011like forms of religion."

This article discusses the relevance of the thesis of a mediatisation of religion presented by Stig Hjarvard for studying religious transformation in a modern, Western society. Though the theory contributes to sociology of religion through its focus on how the characteristics of modern mass media relate to the processes of secularisation, the narrow approach to religion and to the interplay between modernisation and religion in the thesis so far limits its validity. This article suggests two starting points for the development of a theory to better grasp the implications of mediatisation of religion in the contemporary world; first, an understanding of religion that better acknowledges the complexities of modern religion and second, an understanding of mediatisation that also acknowledges the agency of religious actors to take part in the shaping of media as well as modern society."

            "Abstract": "When various media in their entirety mark how we articulate our social worlds, we need an approach of mediatization research that reflects this transmediality. To develop such an approach, the article first discusses the \u201cinstitutionalist\u201d and \u201csocial\u2011constructivist\u201d traditions of mediatization research. Both traditions concur in their understanding of mediatization as being a concept to capture the interrelation between the change of media and communication on the one hand, and the change of culture and society on the other hand. Taking this as a foundation it becomes possible to reflect on the role of certain media as \u201cmoulding forces\u201d, i. e. as certain institutionalizations and reifications of communication. Such a conceptual reflection offers the chance to view the mediatization process as the change of transmedial communicative figurations by which we construct our mediatized worlds. Based on this theoretical foundation, the article subsequently reflects a twofold operationalization, i.e. as diachronous and synchronous mediatization research."

The aim of the book is to develop a systematic exploration of how religious communities engage with a variety of new media technologies. This chapter provides a background to the guiding methodology of the book \u2014 the \u201creligious social shaping of technology\u201d approach. It is argued that previous studies of religious communities\u2019 relationship to new forms of media have often seen media as a \u201cconduit,\u201d as a neutral tool, or as a \u201cmode of knowing\u201d, suggesting media is all powerful and laden with a specific worldview that works independently of the moral and spiritual life of the community. These approaches often do not recognize that religious user communities are active participants negotiating and shaping their technologies in light of their values and desired outcomes. The religious social shaping of technology approach is offered as an alternative, suggesting four distinctive areas that should be explored and questioned in or\u2011 der to fully understand a religious community\u2019s relationship towards new forms of media."

            "Abstract": "This text presents theoretical premises of how to study the reception of media content by the religious audience. The author looks first at how media and mass communication scholarship developed along with the emergence of the media sphere as a technological and social phenomenon. One of the results of these developments is that, with\u2011 in the multiplicity of sources available, specifically religious channels and services, and channels and services that can accommodate religious and spiritual interests and uses, are increasingly possible and available. Secondly, the nature of contemporary religion is undergoing significant change as well. Following the works of W.C. Roof and R. Wuthnow the author considers a religiosity or spirituality of \u201cseeking\u201d as a major dimension of the contemporary religious landscape. The next step of the analysis is considering how various categories of seekers might be positioned vis\u2011\u00e0\u2011vis religious history, religious practice, religious and social experience, orientation toward religious tradition and authority, and religion/spirituality in media culture. The author argues that the evolving religious/symbolic marketplace would be a place where new, more focused mediated symbolic and practical material would be made accessible to interested receivers."

Based on Heidi Campbell\u2019s theoretical approaches and using materials from online observations and field research as sources, the author analyzes two ways of self\u2011representing Old Believers in social media: 1) digital narrative on behalf of the religious community that is an institutionally encouraged and authorized way to make religion visible in public space, 2) digital narrative about the community\u2019s everyday life and Old Believers\u2019 lived religion. Despite all the differences, in both cases visible religion is being constructed online for both internal and external users."

Various forms of communication between the priest and the audience are analyzed, as well as the reasons why both sides choose the online communication. The analysis leads to the conclusion that the mediatization of the pastoral care is due to a combination of two types of motivations: developing new forms of comfortable communication within the parish or overcoming crises that may occur in the parish. Overall, there is a certain general crisis of communication in the Russian Orthodox Church, and the actors are looking for new forms to cope with it. The use of new media is one of such strategies."

The author explores the legal co\u2011existence of two church hierarchies who called themselves Orthodox: Russian Synodal Orthodox Church and Old Believers\u2019 Church of Belokrinitsa agreement. The Edict and the following Circular no. 4628 marked a turning point for religious seekers who considered conversion from one church to another. A number of requests for re\u2011affiliation, sent to Belokrinitsa\u2019s archbishop from representatives of various religious groups, mostly from the Synodal Church, sheds light on how this situation of multi\u2011 Orthodoxy operated, how it was regulated and what were the contra\u2011 dictions emerging on the boundaries of these two canonical domains."

It is shown that at the same time and in the same respect Tolstoy was the bearer of a faith and its investigator; therefore, its adequate interpretation is possible only if the principles established by him for himself are taken into account instead of abstract and outward interpretation of what faith should be. The article considers Tolstoy\u2019s expression of the essence of his faith in numerous works, letters, diaries, etc. during the last thirty years of his life. The article shows the equivalence of Tolstoy\u2019s state of mind and the content of his faith, as well as its purely individual character. The conclusion is made about the significance of Tolstoy\u2019s understanding of faith for us today."

Russian religious dissenters of this period could be hardly viewed as homogeneous or integrated religious culture both historically and socially. However, the study of these movements as well as their representation in various discursive and ideological contexts can tell us a lot about religion in Russia of the \u201cSynodal period\u201d. The paper discusses key aspects of Russian sectarianism in terms of sensational forms, media regimes, moral economies, history of confessionalization and charismatic leadership in popular religious culture."

Sources that were not previously used in the study of this movement (investigative documents of Streltsy riots, the case of queen Evdokia, Major Glebov and others) allow a better reconstruction of the environment in which the shaping of the movement took place, its structure and early history. The author shows the stages of this formative process: the emergence of ecstatic and prophetic practices among the radical Old Believers in the \u201cVyaznikovsky forests\u201d; the transfer of the center of the early movement to Moscow and the formation of the Moscow Khlyst community in connection with the Streltsy riots; emergence of the Khlysty sect; competition between various Khlysty communities and the identification of their local cult centers. The article also highlights the role of different leaders in the history of the sect, the use of extasis in the practice of self-immolations, the role of eschatological ideas in the teachings of Hristovschina, and the similarity of Khlysty\u2019s sect and Old Believers of Netovshchina community."

The study reveals a number of shared features in their origin, development, social makeup, religious ideas and practices as well as their relationships with the authorities. The genesis of the Transylvanian Szombatosok is directly correlated to the European Reformation, and Russian Judaizers are included in the context of the so called Protestantizing movement. Both movements were ultra-radical, spread mostly among peasants, and created similar survival strategies and identities; both experienced gradual de-Christianization and a growing impact of Judaic tradition. However, there were serious differences between the two groups: European intellectual and social elite played a key role in the genesis and early history of Transylvanian Sabbatarianism, which was, to an extent, a specific \u201cconstruct\u201d within the scope of the European religious thought of the 16th-17th centuries; in the Russian case, by contrast, the Judaizers emerged in the low social strata and had their roots in popular movements."

            "Abstract": "In the era of Nicholas I, the policy for further unification of the religious life and stricter surveillance over parishioners led to a rise of investigative cases filed against schismatics. The article discusses how the clergy increased their efforts in revealing the facts of \u201capostasy\u201d of Old Belief among the Orthodox. In the course of these activities, the Russian authorities discovered the imperfection of their own system of surveillance. The paper shows that the active investigation of cases of \u201capostasy\u201d produced the opposite result: instead of drawing people back from \u201capostasy\u201d the policy led to an intensification of religious life of various Old Believer communities. In particular, the paper focuses upon inter-confessional marriages between Orthodox Christians and Old Believers. The legal rules of such marriages were often neglected by the spouses and sometimes by the Orthodox clergy themselves. An analysis is provided of the perception of such marriages by secular and church authorities, and by those marriage couples who were pursued as \u201capostates\u201d."

The paper relies on the relational database developed by the authors during this research. The systematization of archival statistical data and other sources allows the authors to take a closer look at the postniks\u2019 religious life. The population pyramid based on the available data indicates their deep distinction from \u201cordinary\u201d Orthodox peasants of the Tambov province. The same significant differences exist in the number of children in a family and other compared indicators. The authors argue that this specific demographic behavior is a consequence of the worldview attitudes of the postniks rather than any external factors."

The wonderers\u2019 teaching was deeply eschatological, which led to a complete break with \u201cthe world of Antichrist\u201d. The study provides a detailed description of the everyday life of the wanderers. An important feature in the life of these communities was constant and intensive ties between territories where their co-religionists were present. Particular attention is paid to the problems of mutual perception and confrontation between the wanderers and government representatives (police and clergy). The wanderers\u2019 activities, in spite of their eschatological attitudes, showed in fact their intense involvement with the outside world."

Particular attention is paid to the reasons for such \u201cdeviation\u201d (conversion) to Judaizers, the methods of spreading Judaism among the peasants, discussions between the followers of the Sabbaterian sect and Christian Orthodoxy, the circumstances of bringing the sectarian to legal responsibility. The author traces the evolution of religious practices of Pyotr Maklakov and his inner circle. Since he was twice prosecuted by secular and ecclesiastical authorities with an interval of ten years, the archival documents reflect the gradual transition of the sectarian from a \u201cJewish faith,\u201d spontaneously reconstructed from Christian sources, to Orthodox Judaism with its normative practices and prayer in Hebrew according to Siddur. The author also shows a contradictory combination of normative Jewish practices with active missionary activity unusual for rabbinical Judaism."

Among the Arabic sources on Buddhism, this work is considered to be the most important. One of the chapters in this section is a version of the famous Buddhist sutra adapted for the Muslim reader, in which the Buddhist teachings and ethical principles are presented in the form of questions-riddles addressed by a heavenly being to the Buddha as well as his answers. The article provides a survey of various versions of this work that were in use in Buddhist cultures in the Middle Ages, as well as a comparison of the Muslim and Buddhist interpretations of this sutra presented in the Arabic version of the Compendium of Chronicles. The article is followed by a publication of the Arabic text of the sutra based on the only preserved manuscript from the London collection Khalili MSS 727, and its Russian translation."

The authors analyze the bishop\u2019s views on national empowerment, political nationalism and the issue of the non-Russians (inorodtsy). It is demonstrated how bishop Andrey\u2019s Slavophil views shaped his Russian nationalism. The authors also consider the reasons for bishop Andrey\u2019s cooperation with rightwing parties and unions, as well as the events that led to his disillusionment with these political forces. This turn is documented by the inedited materials showing the debate on \u201cthe national issue\u201d in press between bishop Andrey and right-wing politicians in 1910, which led to their final break. Based on bishop Andrey\u2019s journalistic texts published between 1899 and 1917 the authors conclude that he endorsed Russian national self-assertion but never aligned himself with nationalism that he condemned as anti-Christian as long as it acquired xenophobic, racist and secular aspects. Ultimately, while remaining the supporter of the Russian national idea in its Orthodox and Slavophil interpretation, by 1917 he had become a staunch opponent of Russian political nationalism."

Eschatological doctrine of the group could be characterized both as \u201ccatastrophic\u201d and \u201cprogressive\u201d millennialism. Eschatological social project suggested the elimination of the border between the earthly and heavenly realms and a shift towards egalitarian social model through a total renewal of the present world. The analysis of the documents demonstrates that the circle members considered themselves as active participants of the eschatological process. According to the catastrophic worldview of the circle\u2019s members, the final battle of Good and Evil, which involves both human and spirits, is already in progress. In advance of the Apocalypse, ethical questions were crucial, because the realization of the ethical ideal was a key to salvation. The members of the circle perceived the outside world as a hostile environment and tended to redraw the boundaries between the community and the \u201cinfected\u201d world."

Researchers are not able to convincingly estimate the number of its adherents. Sociological surveys are too contradictory, and we can try to rely upon the data collected on the Internet. Some authors have already used these data by counting the number of Neo-Pagan groups and followers in the social networks. The purpose of this paper is to assess the validity of such calculations. After having monitored various religious groups in such popular Russian social services as the Odnoklassniki and VKontakte for a few years, the author shows that this method of calculation is inefficient and can lead to errors. Therefore, the actual number of adherents of the Russian Neo-Paganism remains unknown even approximately."

Authors show that public expression of the priest\u2019s opinion on political issues during the sermon is not that efficient as in the situation when undecided believers turn to priests with questions on political issues. The support of \u201cUnited Russia\u201d becomes most efficient when believers discuss their electoral choices within their church community."

            "Abstract": "A perception of \u201cChristian bioethics\u201d developed by the American philosopher Hugo Tristram Engelhardt in Russia requires a systematic interdisciplinary analysis. This is due to the realities of medical practice, as well as cultural and historical differences between the Russian and American societies. In Russia, there are certain difficulties in the open discussion of ethical issues in the public sphere. However, the recently growing participation of the Orthodox Church in public debates on the issues of medicine and biotechnology produce a basis for a reception of Engelhardt\u2019s Christian bioethics. This article presents an analysis of how Engelhardt\u2019s academic carrier was connected to his personal transformation, and how a \u201clogical positivist\u201d and physician interested in genetics, through his studies of continental philosophy, history of medicine, Catholicism and bioethics, came up finally as a founder of Christian bioethics based on Eastern Christian Orthodoxy. This analysis is purposed to expand the theoretical discussion of moral dilemmas posed at the intersection of medicine, religion and philosophy within the Russian academic discourse."

Secular bioethics rose in response to the demands of these new biomedical technologies in the context of a culture fragmented in moral pluralism. While secular bioethics promised to unite persons separated by diverse religious and moral assumption, this is a promise that could not be fulfilled. Reason alone cannot provide canonical, content-full moral guidance or justify a moral community capable of binding all persons. Christian bioethics, as part of a way of life embedded in authentic worship, offers content, meaning and understanding where secular bioethics has failed. For Christians, resolution of bioethical controversies will not be found through appeals to foundational rational arguments or isolated scriptural quotations, but only in a Christian community united in authentic faith."

In contemporary discourse, it refers to disputes regarding significant moral matters carried out in the public square and for which there appears to be no way to achieve consensus or compromise. One set of battle lines is drawn between those who hold traditional Christian commitments and those who do not. Christian bioethics is nested in a set of moral and metaphysical understandings that collide with those of the dominant secular culture. The result is a gulf between a moral life and an approach to bioethics framed in the face of a transcendent God and a final judgment versus a moral life and an approach to bioethics framed as if the world were without ultimate meaning and as if death were the end of personal existence. These approaches are separated by a moral and metaphysical gulf that sustains incompatible life worlds and incompatible understandings of bioethics. Attempts to bridge the gulf with secular reason are ineffective because there is no shared conception of reason or standard of evidence. Efforts to use the state to enforce a particular set of metaphysical and moral commitments, whether secular or religious, lead to public disputes with a war-like character."

The appeal to Fritz Jahr\u2019s ideas in the field of bioethics allows us to assess the contribution of Christian thinkers to the articulation of bioethical issues and to raise the question of why in modern bioethics, which is trying to draw upon universal, non-religious values, there was a demand for theological works of a Protestant pastor. The article describes the attitude to bioethics in Germany at the turn of the 1980s\u201390s, the ideological conflict of the \u201canti-bioethics\u201d movement and the context of the new reception of Fritz Jahr\u2019s works."

Pregnancy of an adopting woman represents only a visible, technical similarity to the surrogacy; it is now commonly called \u201csnowflake adoption.\u201d In fact, such a pregnancy implies a different meaning and different goals. The study considers the following ethical dilemma: an invasion into marital union while using surrogacy for embryo adoption versus the potential death of an embryo in the absence of surrogacy. Any person, as Christian anthropology claims, originates from the first moment of conception. Therefore, respect for personal dignity includes the preservation of life and health at the embryonic stage even in a cryopreserved state. The potential death of a frozen embryo would be considered a more significant ethical evil than the intrusion of an adoptive mother into a marital union. Thus, snowflake adoption can be ethically justified to save a cryopreserved embryo if a woman adopts it and will raise the born child."

This topic is particularly relevant in connection with the current discussion of the alienation of women\u2019s reproductive function. According to infant care manuals, while choosing a wet nurse, doctors recommended that mothers consider not only physical aspects, but also ethical issues. However, in practice, the ethics receded into the background. Wet nurses were used in almost all families that had reached a certain financial and social status. Doctors\u2019 recommendations were referred to justify the fact that mothers should not feed their own infants. Therefore, such recommendations served to justify an ethically questionable practice. The most serious medical problem was that wet nurses were distributors of syphilis. Many nurses started their work in orphanages where they contracted syphilis from infected foundling babies. As it was impossible to diagnose syphilis at the early stages, the infected wet nurse would become the carrier of the disease and, when hired by a family, infect the customer\u2019s child.

            "Abstract": "This paper critically explores key aspects of the gulf between Christian bioethics and the secular moral reflections that dominate contemporary bioethics. For example, in contrast to traditional Christian morality, the established secular bioethics judges extramarital sex acts among consenting persons, whether of the same or different sexes, as at least morally permissible, affirms sexual freedom for children to develop their own sexual identity, and holds the easy availability of abortion and infanticide as central to the liberty interests of women. Secular bioethics seeks to separate children from the authority of their parents, placing children themselves as in authority to make their own judgments about appropriate lifestyle choices, including sexual behaviors. As I argue, however, when God is absent, there exists no standpoint outside of our own cultural socio historically conditioned understanding from which to communicate any deeper perspective of reality or the bioethics that such a perspective would secure. Consequently, rather than discerning moral truth, secular bioethics merely affirms its own particular cultural socio historically conditioned ideological perspective. It is a social and political worldview bereft of definitive moral foundation, independent moral authority, or unambiguous content."

            "Abstract": "This paper studies the attitudes of the Soviet authorities and society towards the problem of abortion during the New Economic Policy (NEP). In the 1920s, communist ideologists and population still under influence of traditional values based on religious ethics (though often indifferent towards religion and Church) expressed extremely different views on the issue. Even religiously indifferent people used to take part in religious ceremonies such as weddings and christenings. The traditions of the Orthodox Church provided them with moral support in the era of global changes. The ideological message of the Soviet authorities was also controversial. Officially sexual liberty was allowed, as was the freedom of marriage and divorce. Women were encouraged to work, to be involved in social activities, to be educated. However, there was little social and medical help for mothers. Traditional marriage was being destroyed, and an increasing number of abortions, both legal and illegal, was a result.\u00a0 Those who were in charge of the sanitary propaganda were worried and encouraged people to have children for Soviet Russia instead of abortions despite all difficulties. In fact, ordinary people knew that many children meant poverty and poor health for the whole family. There was almost no available contraception, and abortion was virtually only method of birth control. In spite of the efforts of Soviet propaganda, abortion was perceived as a nasty but almost unavoidable part of everyday life. The author concludes that no consensus on the problem of abortion in the Soviet society of the 1920s emerged, and to some extent it could not have emerged under such circumstances."

            "Abstract": "This paper examines changes in the liturgical and paraliturgical practices of Roman Catholics in Soviet Russia in the 1920s and 1930s. Nine documents from different archives outside Russia were first used to show changes made at the request of Russian Catholics. These documents deal with a number of disciplinary issues, such as the time for the celebration of Mass, observation of a natural fast before Mass, permission for lay people to bring Holy communion to the sick or imprisoned people. The Holy See readily relaxed canonical requirements. Consequently, at the turn of the 1920s and 1930s, the time for the celebration of Mass became variable, moving more often to the evening hours; the rules of a natural fast before Mass for clergy and laity were relaxed, which paved the way for regular communion at evening Masses; laity were given permission to bring Holy communion to those who could not personally hear the Mass; the practice of stipends for Mass became an instrument of financial support given by the Holy See to impoverished Catholic clergymen in critical situations. The main reason for these dramatic changes was the anti-religious policy of the Soviet government and the disruption of the traditional calendar. The fact of continuing contacts with the Vatican sheds light on those aspects of religious life in Soviet Russia that are not reflected in the official Soviet documentation."

The author analyzes the phenomenon of the restoration of group pilgrimages as a process of reinventing the pilgrimage tradition first developed mainly in the peasant milieu at the turn of the twentieth century. The annual trips from France organized by Bishop Methodian Kulman served as the basis for the new pilgrimage movement and the formation of a new community of \u201cco-pilgrims\u201d, uniting Russian Orthodox emigrants from all over the world. Perceived as a romantic ideal, the old peasant pilgrimage to Palestine became a source of new meanings for pilgrims in the second half of the 20th century. The author explores the process of gradual ritualization and formalization of the trips; the reconstruction of the Russian mental map of the Holy Land; the use of the pilgrimage as a way to cope with longing for the lost homeland and seeking authenticity by reproducing institutions of the past. The pilgrimage, interpreted as a spiritual ideal, became one of the ways to consolidate the Russian emigration."

Main sources include texts revealing spiritualists\u2019 ideas about the structure of the spiritual world; structure and characteristics of spiritual circles; and literary works by spiritualists reflecting their social ideals. Although the social and political views of Russian spiritualists were mostly conservative, their ontological views contained elements of social radicalism. The author distinguishes between the two types of spiritualists \u2014 rationalists and traditionalists \u2014 depending on their attitude towards the Orthodox Church, Christian theology and their specific views about the spiritual world. All spiritualists viewed the society critically as gripped with disease. Rationalist spiritualism was critical towards Christian dogmatic and practice, and although its supporters advocated the preservation of the social and political status quo, they hoped for both gradual social and political transformation and the realization of social ideals in the spiritual world. The traditionalists, despite their commitment to monarchy and the Church institution, expected a millenarian overturn and thus challenged the social and political order. Overall, the spiritualist social ideals are close to communitarian social projects based upon the idea of Christian brotherhood."

The author explores the internal mechanism of Islamic discourse, which works to protect the sphere of Muslim dogmatic (\u2018aqida) from the \u201calien\u201d influence and is realized through the delineation of protective boundaries.

The paper analyses the development of the narrative, the argumentation used by Gabashi and the behavior of those involved in the polemics.

As the Muslim author, Gabashi does not reject the entire Christian doctrine or the entire Bible, but selectively criticizes \u201cdistortions\u201d that are contrary to Islam."

            "Abstract": "In recent decades scholars have done much to correct the previous neglect of the Russian Orthodox Church, but secular historians have virtually ignored this massive volume of dissertations, books, and articles on the Church. That also applies to the role of the Church in 1917. Although that neglect is largely due to the secularist bias in the traditional historiography, it is at least partly attributable to the new scholarship on the Church \u2014 which has tended to have a narrow focus: the internal history of the Church. That is, it has concentrated on the \u201chistory of the Church\u201d, not on the \u201cChurch in history\u201d. To shift that focus to the latter (and make the research more meaningful for secular historians), it is essential to redirect attention from the \u201cChurch\u201d and clergy (especially elites) to the \u201cchurch\u201d (parish) and lay believers. This study seeks to encourage that new direction in scholarship and explores how the Church reforms in the spring turned into a parish revolution in the summer. It draws upon a number of archival repositories (central and local) as well as the Orthodox press (especially the diocesan gazettes). It shows how the crisis at the top (in central and diocesan administration) undermined the capacity of the \u201cChurch\u201d to govern the \u201cchurch,\u201d how the laity asserted their authority over parish finances and the local clerical staff, and how the parish clergy responded (most dramatically, by forming unions to defend their rights and interests)."

The parish issue turned out to be closely intertwined with all major social and political problems: the crisis of the peasant community, urbanization, the reform of local government, the church education system, and the material support of the clergy. However, as a part of the imperial state ma\u2011 chine, the Synodal system was not able to solve this issue, due to at least four factors: inter\u2011departmental competition; politization of the issue; the lack of public consensus; and the lack of a unified will that would guide comprehensive reforms."

Legal restrictions placed upon the Church forced Orthodox leaders to consider the value of their own canonical laws and how to apply them in an inimical context. At the same time, the Church\u2019s long history of internal disagreement over the meaning and application of canon law before 1917 left it vulnerable both to the Bolsheviks\u2019 intellectual and moral critiques of Church law, and also to their legal restrictions on the Church."

The article is based on the unpublished documents from the Beneshevich archive in St. Petersburg. The documents help reconstructing religious life of the country of the first post\u2011revolutionary years (1917\u20131922). Their significant part deals with the problems of the canonical law, mostly related to the issue of autocephaly of the Georgian Church. In spring 1917, Beneshevich was sent to Tiflis by order of the Provisional government as a Temporary Commissioner for the Affairs of the Georgian Church. Numerous documents (correspondence, documents of the Provisional government, newspaper clippings, etc.) help to see how a complex conflict between Beneshevich, the Russian authorities and the representatives of the Georgian Church unfolded between the two revolutions of 1917."

The nature of Renovation\u2011 ism is not obvious, which led to the emergence of different historiographical concepts. This phenomenon is explored here on the basis of a wide range of sources, both open (as the press of the 1920s) and previously classified documents (primarily from secret services and the highest Soviet authorities). The real nature of the interaction between the \u201cLiving Church\u201d and the GPU in the 1920s and in subsequent years is analyzed. It is shown the Soviet Renovationists fought against the so\u2011called \u201cChurch counterrevolution\u201d (in fact, informing the secret services). Church reforms announced by the leaders of the Renovationists were finally reduced to the non\u2011canonical admission of the married episcopate and the remarriage of clergy. The desire to accommodate to the Soviet regime was clearly prevailing over any religious content. Overall, the Renovationist schism was a negative result of the process of secularization that affected the Church environment, aggravated by the realities of cruel political repressions and social transformations."

After the Emancipation, former serfs found new opportunities as laborers, factory workers, entrepreneurs, and even priests, monks, and holy men. Vasilii Karpovich Podgornyi was one such serf who, after Emancipation, became a successful businessman. Inspired by traditional piety he used his entrepreneurial skills to create networks of religious communities, primarily composed of pious women. Podgornyi\u2019s remarkable success sharply split the church hierarchy. Some conservative hierarchs regarded this former serf as a suspicious figure, a pervert who took advantage of his female followers. Because of such accusations, Podgornyi spent ten years in a monastic prison. Other clergy, including Podgornyi\u2019s monastic jailers, became his strong advocates and ultimately succeeded in seeing him freed from prison. Podgornyi\u2019s movement, however, remained controversial and illustrates the sharp social tensions within the church before the Bolshevik Revolution."

It is noted that the Great War contributed to the spread of mystical and eschatological sentiments among the different social groups, the growing popularity of sects, and the simultaneous wave of unchurching (rastserkovlenie)."

It centers on two questions: How did women\u2019s faith impact their experience of the Revolution under Bolshevik rule? And how did women\u2019s religious beliefs, behaviors, and faith\u2011based relationships influence how the Revolution was \u201clived\u201d? Moving beyond the problematic category of \u201cbackwardness\u201d traditionally assigned to female believers in the revolutionary context, it privileges women\u2019s perspectives and highlights a diverse set of responses to socialist rule. And by encouraging a rethinking of the interrelationship between gender and faith in early Soviet society, it aims to open up new avenues of inquiry with respect to the experience of \u201clived socialism\u201d."

The authors of these prayers and rites lived at the time of the Revolution and witnessed events as they took place; everything they were seeing and participating in summoned forth an immediate response from deep within their living faith.

The secular segment of the Buriat society viewed the collapse of the monarchy as the unfolding opportunity to get rid of the colonial legacy, including discrimination of their religion. However, already in 1918 the deviation of the positions of clerical and secular segments of the Buriat society became obvious. If the Buriat nationalists remained hostile to the idea of Restoration, the official Buddhist circles supported admiral Kolchak, whereas a part of rank\u2011and\u2011file lamas consolidated around the idea of Buddhist theocracy. After the Soviet regime firmly established in Trans\u2011Baikal area, a part of the Buddhist monks, the Buddhist renovationists under leadership of Agvan Dorzhiev, attempted to come to terms with the Bolsheviks. These attempts ended in the total defeat of the organized Buddhist community by the late 1930s."

New Israelites were the largest of all overseas \u201csectarian\u201d groups that responded to the Soviet authorities\u2019 call to return to the country and take part in creating collective agricultural enterprises. The co\u2011operative enterprise established by that religious community on the territory of the present day Rostov Region endured for a few years. Shortly thereafter, due to changes in government policies, it was transformed into a sovkhoz and lost its economic and ideological autonomy. The article demonstrates, using private correspondence between the movement\u2019s leaders as evidence, that contrary to popular opinion, political and ideological considerations did not play a significant role in their decision to re\u2011emigrate. Key factors behind the re\u2011emigration to Soviet Russia were the catastrophic financial situation in which the New Israel community in Uruguay found itself, as well as the threat of criminal prosecution looming over its leaders. The leftist and communist language frequently employed by the New Israel leadership was mainly a rhetoric tool used to solve practical issues in the short run."

The author studies this question through changes in the views of denominational leaders. Two transformations of the political identity of denominations are revealed: the first covers the period from the February Revolution to the fall of 1917, the second, from the fall of 1917 to the fall of 1922. From pre\u2011revolutionary demonstrative political apathy and loyalty to autocratic regime, in the spring of 1917, the leadership of Evangelical Christians and Baptists switched to a very active political position, supporting the Provisional Government and its democratic, liberal reforms. However, with the increasing social chaos and the apparent inability of the Provisional Government to cope with the situation in the country, by the fall of 1917 the denominations have returned to the old principles of loyalty and political neutrality, now in a completely different socio\u2011political and legal situation. The end of the Civil War throughout Soviet Russia coincides with the beginning of the \u201canti\u2011sectarian\u201d policy of the Soviet power. The leadership of the evangelical Christians stayed with their apolitical loyal position towards the Soviet authorities, up to the rejection of the principle of anti-militarism, and, on the other hand, with their sympathy for liberal Western values that now became totally impossible."

            "Abstract": "Today, the ideas of the Russian monarch or Russia itself as \u201ckatechon\u201d are popular in the right\u2011conservative circles, and on this basis attempts are made to explain the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the subsequent events of the twentieth century as a fight against \u201ckatechon\u201d up to his \u201critual murder\u201d. According to these views, the Freemasons and Jews were responsible for the Revolution, as they were preparing the coming of the Antichrist. What role such representations played in pre\u2011revolutionary and revolutionary Russia and whom did they attract? The article speaks about the popularity of the prophecies about the end of the world in Russia at the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, shows how the faked \u201cProtocols of the Elders of Zion\u201d fit into this context, and analyzes how and why the myth of Jewish and Freemasons\u2019 conspiracy directly followed from these prophecies."

The first part of the paper focuses on anti\u2011socialist texts by radical right Orthodox clergy who argued for the impossibility to reconcile Christianity and socialism, and interpreted them as rigid categories. The second part of the paper discusses various intellectual experiments by left\u2011wing Orthodox clergy and by Marxist intelligentsia who looked at Christianity and socialism as fluid ideas under contestation. The paper argues that these projects highlight two interlinked issues: the social(ist) nature of Christianity and the religious nature of Marxist socialism. The article concludes with a short reflection on these projects: Orthodox Social Gospel (or Christian social action) and the Marxist God\u2011building movement."

Lunacharsky on religion, which he developed in close connection with Gorky\u2019s God\u2011building, and A.A. Bogdanov\u2019s critique of religion and religious language as a form of authoritarian ideology. Their opposite views on religion were formulated within the same context, where revolution, for both of them, had to invest not only the political structures, but also the ways of thinking and feeling, of making sense of life and death. While for Lunacharsky the faith in the collective and the drive toward happiness for all should be expressed in a religious form, according to Bogdanov socialism has to be a \u201cscientific\u201d conception of the world. After 1917 both thinkers reasserted the importance, respectively, of feelings and passions, as well as of a new \u201cproletarian\u201d science."

At the empirical center of this story is a once famous memorial plaque, featuring a large winged figure symbolizing the revolution, installed on the first anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution on Red Square above the graves of the martyrs of October. Exploring such imagery, including possible sources and resonant parallels, this paper asks what the religious and the sacred meant at the level of revolutionary ideas, emotions, and lived experience. Resurrection, transcendence, utopia, the superman, and the Marxist \u201cleap\u201d out of the \u201ckingdom of necessity\u201d are key interpretive themes."

Its main thesis is that rather than being an obstacle, Orthodox Christianity to some extent contributed to the revolution\u2019s success by providing familiar semantic background against which the majority of Russians interpreted, accepted and fought for the socialist ideals. It argues that Orthodoxy was the source of hegemonic cultural values and that it functioned as dominant, yet circuitous, semantic filter through which ideas surrounding the revolution were understood and appropriated by the masses. In constructing its argument the discussion relies on Antonio Gramsci\u2019s ideas about cultural hegemony, Iurii Lotman\u2019s concept of semiosphere and Ernest Bloch\u2019s theory about utopianism as a necessary element of radicalism."

The author addresses the reasons of the increasing reputation of the franchise as an important phenomenon of popular culture which grew out from a low-budget independent film. This fame cannot be explained only by the fact that it has become a transmedia phenomenon (musical, theater, video games, comics, remake, TV series, etc.). The author clarifies the concepts of \u201cpopular culture\u201d and \u201cfantasy\u201d and applies both to \u201cThe Evil Dead.\u201d The article then discusses whether the franchise can be associated with a type of new religiosity referring to the concept of \u201chyper-real religion\u201d by Adam Possamai. Such \u201creligion\u201d is based upon the products of popular culture and has only representations with no real referent (\u201csimulacra\u201d). Although \u201cThe Evil Dead\u201d cannot be recognized as a proper hyper-real religion, it can be classified as a hyper-real cult. The concept is associated with the phenomenon of the cult cinema and includes some ritual practices of consumption by fans. The author believes that the demand for the franchise is explained, among other things, by the influence of Howard Lovecraft whose work is of particular importance in the context of hyper-real religion and, in particular, for the original trilogy of \u201cThe Evil Dead\u201d."

While borrowing many of them, the developers change them in small but significant ways. By doing so they manage to create a unique approach to representing religion which is strongly shaped by secular ideology dominating the genre. This allows us to call \u201cDragon Age: Inquisition\u201d a post-secular videogame that adapts many traditional Christian narratives and conflicts with the new and unfamiliar medium."

Both films are read as a political-theological statement. They feature creatures that are biologically almost indistinguishable from humans, the \u201creplicants\u201d. They are used to colonize distant planets and are forbidden to live on Earth. In the first film of 1982, the design of the replicants presupposed an early death, and they rebelled against humans because they wanted to live longer. In the second film, their design presupposes submission, but they rebel again against such slavery. The script can be understood as a history of man\u2019s relationship with the Creator. The film\u2019s intrigue further addresses the notion of miracle in connection with the notion of revolution. The replicant\u2019s ability to have children, and thus to refute the boundary between them and the humans, is presented as a miracle. However, only those who possess authority and power to set the norms and laws can proclaim a miracle as such. In the film, this right is assigned to the replicants: their uprising means the transfer of the transcendent into a plan of immanence. Their belief in a miracle lies precisely in the fact that the Creator, and the belief in the Creator, is not necessary."

            "Abstract": "This article analyses the way in which Black Mirror\u2019s contemporary TV science fiction doesn\u2019t just infuse science fiction (SF) with a narratively supernatural force, but implicitly reflects on religious matters and even acts as a version of \u201cimplicit religion\u201d. The author argues that Black Mirror\u2019s reception context, as a show that is frequently binged by fans, positions it in relation to experiences of the sacred within consumerist everyday life. The article also explores how Black Mirror has represented religious notions within SF as a genre, given that science fiction has arguably experienced \u201cgenre evaporation\u201d as SF tropes and imagery have become culturally generalised. The article considers how SF and religion can intersect, drawing on a modified functionalism. Although Black Mirror might be assumed to represent a cultural moment where science fiction has collapsed as a distinctive genre, the author suggests that the series nonetheless explores forms of uncanny digital salvation and immersion, as well as ritualised uses of technology. The series may not have given rise to a \u201cfiction-based religion\u201d in Markus Davidsen\u2019s terms, but it nevertheless characteristically represents discourses surrounding new technology as a manifestation of implicit religion."

The work is considered as a cultural product within the science-fiction tradition of the second half of the twentieth century. It is shown that the complexity of the series consists in how it weaves elements of Shinto and Abrahamic religions as equally relevant. Through the use of religious topics, the science fiction work acquires inner cognitive logic. The religious in the series is represented on two levels: an implicit one that defines the plot originality, and also an explicit one, when the references to religious matters become a strategy of promoting the series on Japanese and Western mediamarkets. In order to seize at times controversial and nonconcerted religious symbols, the author proposes to use postsecular framework of analysis and the elements of postmodern philosophy of culture. The author then proposes his own analysis of the product\u2019s narrative using the religious optic of Apocalypse."

            "Abstract": "The article explores a possible conflict between practical and ethical implications of scientific and religious discourses about human nature proposed by the sci-fi series \u201cAltered Carbon.\u201d It discusses the clash between biopolitically implemented technology and the religious life. The scientific discourse is represented by the \u201cideology of the cerebral subject\u201d (F. Vidal, F. Ortega), which establishes the connection between the brain and the self. A brief examination of examples of the embodiment of this ideology in science fiction and its general logic follows. Final development of neuroscience in this series is technology of uploading self on a digital carrier, which allows to achieve quasi-immortal state by changing bodies. This technology, biopolitically appropriated and introduced by the state in individual lives, conflicts with the religious life of neo-Catholics who refuse to transfer their self after bodily death into another body. Thus, the field of collision of the intervention of the science-inspired biopower into the life of the individual and her religious life is marked by the coordinates of life and death. The article discusses this fundamental collision, its biopolitical background and its implications."

Within this fantasy universe, religious communities, institutions and conflicts are not constructed around theological doctrines, nor do they refer to the issues usually associated with religious faith (such as cosmology, eschatology, ethics or worship). Instead, their cornerstone appears to be the question regarding violence and their attitude towards the Other. In many respects, this game is a typical product of contemporary pop-culture: religions, religiousness, faith and believers are portrayed here from a secular perspective. As a result, it is the question of religious cults\u2019 willingness to peacefully co-exist with each other and the world around them that comes to the forefront, while issues that are less interesting for nonbelievers are downplayed or ignored. This article aims to show one of the dominant strategies of representation of religions and believers in contemporary videogames."

The authors consider its structural characteristics and analyze in detail the two closely related value-practical structures: the concept of the family and the relationship with the supernatural. They find in the series an archaic concept of the family as a blood brotherhood opposing the outside world. The supernatural is revealed as a concrete form of circumstances hostile to the family and is rationalized within the framework of a flat ontology, reducing all kinds of \u201cotherworldly\u201d to a common denominator \u2014 the method of destruction. As a result, the line between \u201csuper\u201d and \u201cnatural\u201d is erased. Any forms of ontological dualism that distinguish between the \u201csacred\u201d and the \u201cworldly\u201d become impossible. But the destruction of the way of life of \u201cmonsters\u201d turns into an empirical procedure of checking the existence of any form of the supernatural through its falsification (destruction). The authors characterize the position of the heroes of the series as non-religious multi-theism and find in the world of the Supernatual a peculiar form of the anthropic principle: \u201cmonsters\u201d are needed for the family\u2019s existence and the promotion of family values, and only due to the hunters\u2019 family the supernatural is discovered and reaches a \u201cnatural\u201d existence."

            "Abstract": "This article describes the changes in understanding the role and identity of the Russian Orthodox priesthood during late 18th \u2014 mid-19th centuries. The analysis of normative texts defining the image of parish priests reveals the gradual differentiation of the social contexts. While at the start of the period the priest acts within a more or less homogenous society, during the first decades of the 19th century this context is gradually reconsidered within binary opposition of church vs. civil (secular). The Church emerges within the priestly narratives as a category that organizes the social space (in/outside the Church) and is often described by such strong epithets as \u201cpersecuted\u201d, \u201cmilitant\u201d etc. The revealed change may be interpreted within the theory of confessionalization: the 19th century was indeed a time when modern confessional identities emerged across Europe. The category of \u201cchurch,\u201d \u201cchurchiness\u201d, \u201cchurchy,\u201d etc. became crucial for self-identification of confessional societies whose hierarchies sought to create the symbolic demarcation of confessional spaces."

            "Abstract": "There is an ongoing debate regarding the dialectics of secularization in the West. One of the key works in the field is Charles Taylor\u2019s A Secular Age, exploring the role of metaphysics in the development of Western secularism. Yet the process of secularization in the Russian context largely remains beyond the scope of the current scholarly discussions. Dealing with the dialectics of secularization in the history of Russian philosophy, the author draws a parallel between Charles Taylor\u2019s fundamental work and Vasily Zenkovsky\u2019s History of Russian Philosophy. The aim of the paper is to show that Zenkovsky\u2019s work can be viewed as an analysis of secular and antisecular discourses in the Russian intellectual landscape. Despite major methodological shortcomings in the analysis of secularization, Zenkovsky does a brilliant work as a historian of ideas. The detailed examination he provides helps us to trace the influence of secular \u2018Nova-Effect\u2019 (Taylor\u2019s concept) in the Russian context. Among the main shortcomings of Zenkovsky\u2019s work are insufficient conceptual articulation of the notion of secularism as well as the lack of attention to the political context of Russian philosophical discourse. Nevertheless, a careful analysis of Zenkovsky can trigger further research of the dialectics of secularization in the history of the Russian thought."

            "Abstract": "In contemporary Catholicism, the reflection of faithful on the way of life or vocation implies the acquisition of interpretative skills that allow to define God\u2019s will with a degree of certainty. The process of vocational discernment constitutes a hermeneutic work of a Catholic with his or her inner states \u2014 consciousness, emotions \u2014 and various outer shreds of evidence indicating that this specific life project is precisely what God is calling for. Observation of the signs of God\u2019s presence and care does not necessarily mean that these signs will be recognized correctly. Within local semiotic ideologies, God\u2019s signs decipherment is considered as an inherently subjective act. In this regard, the main peril for a Catholic who discerns vocation is an interpretation of signs in such a way that their meaning coincides with the one\u2019s own view of vocation. The Church authority offers a solution for this problem by the cultivation of ethical self\u2011reflectiveness and sincerity. The metaphor of sincerity as personal transparency that is common in Russian Catholic milieu serves for reinforcement of faithful\u2019s moral commitments of accountability towards the Church."

The contemporary Orthodox ideologists achieve this aim by using the so\u2011called double interpretation, when they discover under the outer appearance of events of the past (such as the murder of the Russian Tsar\u2019s family), first, a conspiracy, and second, the transcendental universal meaning."

The concept of \u201csemiotic ideologies\u201d by Webb Keane is one of the analytical tools that allow us studying the norms, expectations and rules of such communications. In New Age culture, practices of \u201cin\u2011 formation exchange\u201d with nonhuman agents and transpersonal forces are based on specific techniques, mainly the so\u2011called channeling or contact. The analysis of particular ethnographic examples related to ufological channeling leads to the conclusion that this practice creates new types of collective agency, which seems to be one of the distinctive features of the New Age culture as such."

            "Abstract": "The purpose of this article is to explain Ignatius of Loyola\u2019s method of spiritual cognition. The analysis demonstrates that Ignatius\u2019 method can be understood as a specific way of thinking when the thoughts of a person are recognized as authored not by the person himself but by God. This explanation is based upon Ignatius\u2019 \u201cSpiritual Exercises\u201d but also upon the texts by Ludolph of Saxony and Joannes de Caulibus. The text that serves as an example of using the method of spiritual cognition is Ignatius\u2019 own \u201cSpiritual Diary\u201d. Visions and a special gift of speech (loq\u00fcela) described in the \u201cSpiritual Diary\u201d are analyzed in terms of their origin and functional significance as the main parts of spiritual cognition\u2019s method. Both the visions and the gift of speech are based upon the old mystical tradition of a hybrid passive\u2011active way of auto\u2011communication \u201cI \u2014 Other\u201d within the inner voice, which is perceived as communication with God."

Polish officials feared that the USSR would meddle in Polish domestic affairs using the Orthodox Church, and therefore they tightened control over the Church and the flock. The government wanted to tie the Orthodox community closer to the Polish nation. Religious practice and education were supposed to be Polonized; a number of Orthodox churches and parishes were closed; some disloyal priests were replaced by those loyal to Poland. The government also tried to strengthen the influence of the Catholic Church in Poland\u2019s eastern regions."

Their works, both published and in manuscript, can be classified into five main groups: studies dealing with Abrahamic religions; studies of other world and national religions; studies of religious dissidents (Christian sects and Judaizers); works on the traditional beliefs of the native peoples of the Volga Region, the Urals, Siberia, and the Caucasus; and works on popular religiosity. The focus of this article is mainly upon the latter two topics. In some regions, such as the Altai and the Volga region, religious dissent was linked to ethnic and cultural self-identification, which led to new syncretic religious movements (such as Kougou Sorta and Burkhanism). In spite of their Christianizing agenda, these priest-scholars made a significant contribution to Russian humanities."

The results of these investigations were reflected in numerous publications devoted to historical, sociological, and anthropological questions."

The Faculty of Oriental Languages at St. Petersburg University opened in 1855, and the so-called Anti-Muslim Branch in Kazan Theological Academy opened in 1854. The two schools were usually called the \u201cacademic\u201d and the \u201cKazan missionary\u201d school, respectively. The key figures in the academic school were A. Kazem-bek, V. Rozen, V. Barthold, A. Schmidt, and I. Krachkovsky. Their studies were free from confessionalism and were directed toward the objective examination of Islam and Muslim culture, although as elsewhere in Europe, many of them presumed the superiority of Christianity over Islam. The Kazan missionary school, in contrast, published polemical anti-Muslim works, although they also made a breakthrough in the study of the dogmatic aspects of Islam. Some of the representatives of this school, like M. Mashanov, N. Ostroumov, and P. Zhuze, gradually abandoned direct anti-Muslim polemics."

It explores the forms and methods of Daniel Chwolson\u2019s (1819\u20131911) work on academic protection for the Jewish minority. Apart from his well-known effort to refute blood libel accusations that spanned five decades (1861\u20131911), Chwolson\u2019s activities on behalf of Jews included less obvious projects and approaches. For instance, he attempted ( unsuccessfully) to establish an \u201cassociate professorship for Judaic Studies\u201d at St. Petersburg University in 1896\u201397, which in due course would give birth to the \u201cAcademy of Baron G\u00fcnzburg\u201d. Less apparent, but equally important is his work in refuting anti-Jewish theological presuppositions; in this he followed the footsteps of his admired teacher, Abraham Geiger, and the methodologies of Wissenschaft des Judentums. In so doing, Chwolson argued against Christian confessional distortions of Judaism. His firm insistence that early Jewish sources be used in the study of the New Testament and early Christianity anticipated a turn that would become mainstream in the latter half of the 20th century."

Theirs was some of the first research work in Russia that highlighted the new science of religion. For example, Brullova-Shaskolskaya was one of the first scholars to apply a comparative anthropological method to the study of ancient Roman religion, Ratner-Shternberg investigated material on the beliefs of North American Indians, and Kharuzina made an invaluable contribution by introducing the main issues of the science of religion into her university lectures. Studying the activities of the first women scholars of religion at the turn of 20th century, in one of the most difficult periods of Russian history, provides an opportunity to cover a number of important issues such as women\u2019s education, the inclusion of women in research and in the academic community, and the relationship between science and political power.

            "Abstract": "This paper treats the psychological direction of the study of religion in Russia in the late 19th to early 20th centuries. Psychological approaches to investigating religiosity in Russia in this period can be divided into two main areas: the philosophical-psychological (N.I. Grot, G.I. Chelpanov, L.M. Lopatin, etc.) and the scientific (V.M. Bekhterev, A.A. Tokarsky, V.F. Chizh, A.F. Lazursky, A.I. Jarockij, etc.). Philosophical- psychological researchers engaged in general theoretical questions of the psychology of religion and were influenced by the works of Wundt and James; they debated the psychological interpretation of soul, criticized the positions of physiological monism and parallelism, and developed an evidentiary basis for the spiritualist hypothesis of the soul. Scientific researchers used a methodology proposed in experimental psychology in their study of religious phenomena, and focused not so much on general issues of religion and psychology, as on more specific phenomena; Wundt, James and other Western scholars also significantly influenced their works. It was quite difficult to research religion in Russia of the 19th to 20th centuries, and scientific psychology was more interested in psychological questions than in religion. Nevertheless, Russian scientific psychology of the period did achieve considerable success and recognition. The overall high level of psychological research in Russia led to the advancement of a Russian psychology of religion, and thus the psycho\u2011 logical orientation of the Russian study of religion was ahead of its time in a number of respects."

            "Abstract": "This article is devoted to the main trends in the development of the science of religion in Russia at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century. Unlike in other European countries, Russian universities lacked theological departments, and the study of religion was concentrated exclusively within the Church schools. This was one reason for the late development of the science of religion in Russia. Yet, by the end of 1916, the situation was poised for further development, as Russian religious studies had begun to take shape within Oriental studies, classical studies and ethnography, and in close academic contact with foreign scholars. The researchers working in history of Christianity and biblical studies were in a less favorable position due to censorship restrictions. There were two orientations in the study of religion, one following the tradition of confessional studies, and the other using methods of critical scientific analysis. The latter developed in line with contemporary European scholarship: the evolutionary anthropological approach was commonly used, and sociological theories gradually became more attractive."

            "Abstract": "This article is dedicated to the initial period of the history of Armenian Protestantism in the Russian Empire. It characterizes the basic principles of Russian confessional policy concerning Armenians, such as the state\u2019s support of the Armenian Apostolic Church and its opposition to Catholic and Protestant propaganda among Armenians. This article discusses the background of the Armenian Protestant movement and reveals that it was due to the activity of American missionaries in the Ottoman Empire and of the Basel Missionary Society in Russian Transcaucasia. Further, it describes the history of the formation of the Protestant community in the city of Shamakhi in Baku Governorate and the circumstances of its legalization as a parish of the Evangelical Lutheran Church. It also considers the reasons for the conversion of part of the Shamakhi Armenians to Protestantism and the possible contacts of the Protestants of Shamakhi with foreign religious organizations. The author analyzes the reasons and approaches that guided the officials of the MVD (Ministry of Internal Affairs) and the Caucasus Viceroyalty in the settlement of the conflict between the Armenian Protestants and the religious authorities of the Armenian Apostolic Church. He comes to the conclusion that the religious crisis in Shamakhi was resolved by the Russian powers in compliance with the principles of imperial bureaucratic confessionalism and limited religious tolerance that existed in Russia before 1905."

            "Abstract": "This article provides a phenomenological interpretation of the eschatological experience of the participants in the movement that captured the Kungur and Ordinsky districts of what is now Perm Territory in the second half of 1932. Its center was the small village of Podavikha. During the movement\u2019s liquidation by the the OGPU, the leadership and parish clergy of Kungur eparchy were unsure of their position in relation to what had happened. Someone put the name \u201cIvanovskaya secta\u201d into circulation, after the movement\u2019s spiritual leader, Protopriest Ivan Kotelnikov. Others assert that the participants of the movement remained within the church, and \u201cthere is no division\u201d. Based on sources stored in the Perm State Archives of Social and Political History (PermGASPI), this article shows that the nucleus of the eschatological attitude of the inhabitants of Podavikha was formed from two elements: the experience of a victorious struggle against the \u201crenewal schism\u201d in 1924 and the trauma caused by the process of collectivization."

Based on his rich experience of archival and fieldwork among the Muslims in Russia\u2019s North Caucasus, the author discusses the strengths and weaknesses of contemporary scholarship on Islamic reformation. He focuses on current academic narratives and languages of analytical description, which he argues exaggerate the topics of resistance, modernization and the reformation of Muslim societies. These themes do not exhaust the diversity of problems related to Islam in the modern context. Moreover, they were approached using misleading conceptions dating back to the colonial and Cold War periods. The author argues that the narrative of Islamic reformation proposed by Irina Starodubrovskaya is inappropriate to the study of contemporary Muslim societies. It failed to establish interdisciplinary dialogue and was rejected by most experts. Instead, he suggests seeking alternative and less essentialist explanatory models that pay more attention to Muslims as active actors in the globalized modern world, as well as their religious discourses, practices, and social networks."

Discussion with the reviewer concentrates on two different issues. First is the organization of interdisciplinary dialogue, its goals, rules and conditions of success. The author of the article thinks that such dialogue should not lead to total agreement on some common concept but should consist of a regular exchange of ideas and a search for common ground while adhering to the ethics of communication and respect for opponents. Second is the possibility of research into the contemporary Islamic world using metanarratives in general and the modernization paradigm in particular. The article explains the difference between modernization theories in wide and narrow senses, clarifies the methodological value of early modernization theories and justifies the especially important role of the post-Soviet period in the disruption of traditional culture in the North Caucasus."

            "Abstract": "What is the mechanism of construction and implementation of masculinity and femininity, family and sexuality in various religious communities? Strategies and disciplinary practices, especially related to gender, play a paramount role in all religious cultures. Individual piety and sin are regarded through the prism of proper sexual behavior and precise definition of the role of every gender in a theological discourse. The images of a \u201creal man\u201d and \u201creal woman,\u201d the ideal modes of interrelations and family models are constructed on the basis of various norms, implicit precepts and prohibitions. Gender strategies are impacted with social and political conditions, ecclesiology, hermeneutics, and are changing under circumstances and social changes. This paper introduces the special issue dedicated to the practices of constructing, legitimization, reflection, and maintaining gender norms and values in religious communities. The authors of this issue do not merely analyze femininity and masculinity, sexuality and family relations in various religious communities, but also their interpretation and regulation in the framework of \u201clived religion.\u201d They examine different cases of construction of and reflection on gender in Islam, Roman Catholicism, Evangelicalism, Orthodox Christianity, and Judaism."

The article shows how, in the beginning, within the framework of the predominantly male discourse, the exceptional importance of women, primarily as a mother, was emphasized. Women\u2019s discourse, which appeared later, focused on the problems of women themselves and various forms of violence on the part of men, as well as the appeals for women\u2019s independence."

            "Abstract": "This article analyzes the transformation of gender discourse within contemporary Catholicism after Vatican II Council. The author shows how numerous discussions among Catholic intellectuals and ordinary Catholics on gender equality, women\u2019s role in the church tradition, respect to sexual minorities and other out-groups historically discriminated within the traditionalist conservative approach are being actualized at the current stage of development of Catholic thought. Particular attention is paid to the comparative analysis of the gender concept interpretation on the part of secular and religious theorists. The transformation of gender discourse in Catholic thought is profound in nature and is related both to the development of scientific knowledge and the change in value orientations. That reflects the qualitative changes of religious and political identity. Carrying out the detailed analysis of current debate in the Catholic community linked with the Catholic complementarity theory, which shows the traditional understanding of gender, the author focuses on its critical reflection from the perspective of the later gender theories, in particular those proposed by Judith Butler. The author attempts to point out the interrelation between changes in the perception of gender issues among Catholics and the democratization process. Results of the Global Survey of Catholics\u2019 values are cited to confirm this thesis. Finally, the author carries out a comparative analysis of debates on the gender concept between so-called \u201cconservative\u201d and so-called \u201cliberal\u201d Catholic thinkers. The article notes the specific role of the French and American Catholic thought in the implementation of the gender mainstreaming."

            "Abstract": "In the early and medieval Christian tradition, the gendered body was understood as both an obstacle to the cultivation of virtues and a potential medium of transgression. The contemporary Catholic anthropology has another view of the subject\u2019s body and its senses and desires. This article is concerned with the pastoral project of encouraging priestly and monastic callings in the Russian Catholic parishes. It also specifically looks at its rhetoric, placing significant emphasis on gendered embodiment. Based on participant observation materials and interviews with Catholics, who are \u201ccalled\u201d, the author analyzes the strategies of making a calling to celibacy genuine and persuasive. By including gender and sexuality within the concept of vocation, such rhetoric allows not only to show the consecrated life as something attractive, more intelligible and real but also to raise awareness of what true masculinity and femininity are. Despite the fact that Church discipline prescribes solitude, in this new rhetoric celibacy does not require one to become a disembodied and asexual angel. Conversely, by applying gendered \u00a0embodiment religious specialists emphasize its utmost importance for the vocation, which presupposes celibacy, thereby confronting both early Christian perspective on the sinful body and secular views on the constructed gender."

While discussing believers\u2019 memory of the late Soviet period, the article \u00a0demonstrates that these congregations focused almost exclusively on women. The conviction that believers were not to reflect the \u201coutside world\u201d in appearance was actually a double standard for women, since women\u2019s fashion choices have been much more dynamic than men\u2019s in the Soviet and post-Soviet periods. The article discusses the historical and social significance of the emphasis on women\u2019s appearance, arguing that both a high view of scripture and a nostalgia for the \u201cSoviet past\u201d perpetuated the patriarchal norms held by both men and women in ECB congregations. The authors \u00a0then utilize a series of historical photographs from the 1940s to the 1970s to demonstrate the scope of the transformation of ECB believers\u2019 memory, which did not always accurately reflect late-Soviet reality. The authors conclude that the extensive changes in the social order in general and in women\u2019s fashion in particular in the post-Soviet period strengthened believers\u2019 impulse to isolate themselves from the immoral \u201coutside world.\u201d By following the accepted norms for their external appearance, ECB women\u2019s appearance becomes a marker of their faith and a visible sign of their piety that is so highly prized by their community."

            "Abstract": "This paper investigates the role of the Day of Family, Love, and Fidelity in the deployment of Russian state family policy since 2006. It argues that the holiday is emblematic of a cooperative, rather than synchronous, relationship between Church and state in the promotion of pronatalism and so-called \u201ctraditional family values\u201d, and highlights the ways in which public discourse around the holiday intentionally obscures internal contradictions within the dominant family ideologies of both institutions. Investigating these contradictions, the paper analyzes the manner in which the state deploys a selective segment of the Church\u2019s teachings on marriage, gender, and the family to bolster the official pronatalist agenda while rejecting the Church\u2019s most conservative solutions to demographic decline, such as an abortion ban. Most importantly, the paper examines a problematic connection of the hagiography of Peter and Fevronia \u2014 the basis for the Day of Family \u2014 with pronatalist goals, arguing that the clash between the ideal of family life portrayed in the hagiography and the goals of the holiday now \u00a0celebrated in the saints\u2019 honor points to a larger incompatibility between Orthodox matrimonial theology and the politicized promotion of reproduction."

The authors elaborate them by linking to the reflections on religion\u2019s encounter with (Western) modernity as applied to the case of Eastern Orthodoxy. The article then briefly reviews the official position of the Romanian Orthodox Church on the issues of gender order in the family. After describing the religious situation related to the significant growth of Orthodox parishes in Italy, the authors present the results of fifteen in-depth interviews conducted with Romanian Orthodox women in Italy. They examine several socio-cultural fractures between Romanian and Italian gender orders based on the comparison of women\u2019s perception of societies and families, as well as their strategies related to their experiences of migration. Finally, the paper proposes an application of the sociological concept of diaspora for analyzing the key issues in the relationship among religion, gender, and modernity."

            "Abstract": "Unlike in Western Europe, there is no demand for exclusion of Muslims from the Russian \u201cpolitical market.\u201d There are two reasons for this: the \u201cautochthonous\u201d nature of Islam in Russia and the specific features of the current political system. Due to these two factors, parties with an openly Islamophobic agenda are unlikely to emerge, and public articulation of negative attitudes toward Islam and Muslims is hampered. At the same time, Russia is experiencing tensions similar to those in Western European societies. They include conflicts on the presence of Islamic symbols in public sphere, such as wearing hijab in public schools and building new mosques in Russian regions where Muslims make a minority. In spite of the officially promoted rhetoric of \u201cinter-faith harmony,\u201d the Russian society is deeply polarized; the cultural and symbolic space is divided into unspoken zones of influence. In the regions where Muslims make the majority, the patterns of Islamic presence are different. As for migration from outside Russia, this has not been an issue of public debate until very recently. Central Asian migrants were long perceived in terms of ethnicity rather than in term of religion. More recently, the shift in how they are viewed occured because of: (a) a reflection of the \u201cWestern\u201d agenda by Russian media; (b) increasing \u201cvisibility\u201d of Muslim migrants in public space; (c) some resonant cases of involvement of Central Asian newcomers in terrorist attacks."

Many authors connect such image with terrorism, violence and migration. A securitization of Islam occurs not only in the media, but even in academic research through reproducing the Orientalist approach. Despite the fact that the narrative of Islamophobia is firmly entrenched in many types of discourse about Islam, the simple question remains unanswered: how is this happening? In this paper we try to answer this question by studying the materials of the Russian media. What are the mechanisms of creating the discourse of Islamophobia? How is the opposition of traditional and radical Islam being created? How important is the agenda of the Islam experts our in forging knowledge about Islam? The main goal of this work is to show the mechanism that makes Islamophobia a hegemonic discourse in the Russian media."

            "Abstract": "The present article examines the anti-Jewish polemics in a remarkable Christian Arabic treatise from the eleventh century, the heyday of Arabic culture: the Book of Sessions of Elias of Nisibis (975\u20131046), metropolitan of the Church of the East. In this treatise, Elias presents his discussions with his Muslim interlocutor, the vizier Ab\u016b l-Q\u0101sim al-Maghrib\u012b (981\u20131027). The content of the disputations is transmitted in two substantially different versions: one of them is presented in the Book of Sessions, the other, in Elias\u2019 Epistle to the vizier. The difference between the versions affects the anti-Jewish polemics: while being more personal in Elias\u2019 Epistle to the vizier, it is actually reduced to the quotations from the Qur\u2019\u0101n and the Tafs\u012br of al-\u1e6cabar\u012b in the Book of Sessions. The motives for the editorial changes are examined. The role of the Jews in the interreligious relations was one of the subjects of interest for the vizier. However, the removal of the sharpest anti-Jewish passages from the Epistle after the death of the vizier, lets one conclude that the anti-Jewish arguments were not important for his apologetic strategies but were rather used by Elias as a means to get closer to the vizier."

The study is based upon a sample of data about the numbers of parishioners, which was collected from confession and clerical lists stored in the Central State Archive of Moscow. Significant changes over the period between 1897 and 1913 were discovered: the share of those recorded in confession lists decreased from 30% to 15%. While this reduction was conditioned to a large extent by the growth of the population, statistical tests proved significant differences between samples and proved the decrease of the number of parishioners."

After the revolution and during the 1920s, the communities of\u00a0these Christian sects created a\u00a0type of\u00a0economic associations that formally could correspond to\u00a0the Bolsheviks\u2019 economic policies. The Bolsheviks considered these communities as\u00a0their allies, believing that they could become agents of\u00a0socialist economic forms in\u00a0the agriculture. Spiritual Christians have indeed created communities based on\u00a0a\u00a0specific collectivistic work ethic and moral norms, and they achieved high productivity on\u00a0the lands allocated to\u00a0them by\u00a0the authorities. The paper deals, in\u00a0particular, with a\u00a0region in\u00a0the North Caucasus region. This experiment, although successful economically, was quickly curtailed after the dramatic change of\u00a0Soviet policies in\u00a0the late 1920s, when the sects and their communities were destroyed."

The article further considers various ways used by\u00a0the clergy for adapting to\u00a0the situation of\u00a0constant pressure, as\u00a0well as\u00a0forms of\u00a0assistance to\u00a0the clergy by\u00a0the believers. The article assesses the effectiveness of\u00a0the repressive social and economic measures of\u00a0the state: it\u00a0seems that the state achieved only tactical, but by\u00a0no\u00a0means the final goals. Even with a\u00a0significant reduction in\u00a0their numbers, the clergy was not squeezed out completely of\u00a0the society. The remaining priests were able to\u00a0adapt to\u00a0the new realities and to\u00a0maintain a\u00a0certain influence."

Initially this term was related to\u00a0the lay theologians\u00a0\u2014 particularly to\u00a0Aleksey Khomiakov\u00a0\u2014 but afterwards it\u00a0became related to\u00a0the academic scholars as\u00a0well, such as\u00a0metropolitan Anthony Khrapovitsky, V.I. Nesmelov, etc. The research shows that in\u00a0the first decades of\u00a0the 20th century these authors\u2019 works were perceived in\u00a0different ways: from very enthusiastic support (prelate Ilarion Troitsky) to\u00a0strong critique and opposition (prelate Viktor Ostrovidov). Later the archpriest George Florovsky tried to\u00a0define this trend in\u00a0the Russian theology as\u00a0coming not from the Revelation but from the human experience. The article shows the academic new theology\u2019s important continuity with the ideas and methodology of\u00a0the lay theologians, and their \u00abconfessionalization\u00bb."

In\u00a0this article we\u00a0use the methodology of\u00a0critical study of\u00a0religion within the psychology of\u00a0religion. There are two main strategies to\u00a0construct an\u00a0object of\u00a0research in\u00a0this field: 1) studying of\u00a0how religious senses occur (neurotheology, transpersonal psychology) and\u00a02) studying of\u00a0how religious representations emerge (cognitive religious studies). This paper provides an\u00a0overview of\u00a0these two paradigms through the optic of\u00a0religious/secular dichotomy. Scholars who are trying to\u00a0understand the nature of\u00a0religious phenomena ignore significant amount of\u00a0data of\u00a0the same origin that is\u00a0labeled as\u00a0\u00absecular\u00bb. The author then suggests studying such representations or\u00a0senses beyond the religious/ secular dichotomy."

While Sardar grew up\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0UK in\u00a0the family of\u00a0immigrants from Pakistan and received his education in\u00a0Europe, he\u00a0continues to\u00a0consider himself not only European and British, but also Pakistani and Mus\u2011 lim. His interests vary in\u00a0a\u00a0wide spectrum of\u00a0topics and include Islam in\u00a0the contemporary world, philosophy of\u00a0science, \u00abIslamic science,\u00bb sociology, education, etc. Sardar\u2019s writings and public presentations follow the classical Islamic tradition, i.e., he\u00a0does not designate ethics into a\u00a0separate sphere, but integrates ethics into his every reflection. Based on\u00a0the reviewed works and on\u00a0a\u00a0personal interview with Sardar, the author concludes that the ethical discourse of\u00a0the modern Muslim intellectual is\u00a0deeply grounded in\u00a0Islam and its values. At\u00a0the same time, this discourse utilizes new rational tools as\u00a0a\u00a0necessary value\u2011added component that helps critically rethink the ancient heritage of\u00a0Islam and correlate it\u00a0with today\u2019s world."

Main debates have revolved around the use of the term \u201cecumenism\u201d in the case of such alliances. The article proposes minimal criteria of being \u201cecumenical\u201d \u2014 those that the author calls \u201cecumenical consciousness\u201d. The question of whether striving for Christian unity is a necessary criterion of ecumenism is considered. Based on the work of George Lindbeck, the author shows that the normative image of ecumenism as a movement to achieve unity as a mandatory condition was wrong, and that negotiating unity was not the only possible form of ecumenical interaction. The article also discusses the relationship between theology and ideology in connection with ecumenism."

The article begins with a story about Allan Carlson\u2019s trip to Moscow in 1995, where as a result of a meeting with sociologists, the idea of creating a WCF was born. The author then analyses the cooperation between the WCF and the Russian Orthodox Church as an example of so\u2011called \u201cconservative ecumenism,\u201d which partly replaces classical, more liberal ecumenism, such as that presented by the World Council of Churches. Further, this interaction of the WCF with Russian partners is placed in a broader framework of value\u2011oriented geopolitics and culture wars in Europe, in which the WCF is actively involved. The author concludes that Russia\u2019s turn to \u201ctraditional values\u201d is not a reference to the country\u2019s past but rather the reverse: namely, the reflection of value polarization in the pluralist society. The work is based on previously unpublished material, including interviews with activists, as well as archival materials related to the history of the WCF."

            "Abstract": "The 500th anniversary of the Reformation in 2017 was held in Ger\u2011 many for the first time as an ecumenical event. Within its framework, a number of important official church documents about rethinking the history of the Reformation were adopted, common worship services held, and a large number of projects implemented at the region\u2011 al, national and international levels. However, the celebrations can also be viewed as an indicator of a number of important problems in the contemporary dialogue between the Catholics and the Protestants: the ecumenical expectations are too high, and the different ecclesiological models of unity lead to difficulties in the field of pastoral work (inter\u2011confessional marriages) and contemporary social and ethical issues. At the same time, it is no longer just a dialogue between the two German \u201cmajority Churches\u201d but also a quest for a future in rapidly secularizing society. For both confessions, ecumenism, to a certain extent, becomes a joint \u201canti\u2011crisis strategy\u201d of survival in the secular world."

He engages with the works of J\u00fcrgen Habermas and argues that Habermas\u2019s conception of secularization is too closely linked to the European model in which secularization and modernization are correlated. Casanova argues that the world may be becoming \u201cpost\u2011secular,\u201d characterized by the re\u2011emergence of religion as a public issue in some societies. He concludes by identifying three main reasons for this new attitude: globalization, Europe\u2011 an integration, and increasing religious pluralism due to immigration."

The article analyzes \u201chumility\u201d (smirenie) \u2014 one of the key virtues of the contemporary economic ethics of the Russian Orthodox Church. The author builds a typology of various understandings of humility in today\u2019s Russian Orthodoxy in connection with economic practices of Ortho\u2011 dox actors. The article distinguishes seven types of humility, each of which may be associated with its vision of economy and social relations. They are grouped into two main clusters \u2014 humility associated with obedience to another person and humility that is not related to such an obedience. The author makes a conclusion that this key ethical category of Orthodoxy can denote quite different types of relations and economic motivations. This, in turn, means that quite different types can be preached at the same time, from more productive to even possibly destructive. The article provides examples showing that under the name of humility there may be ethical ideas in the discourse, the accentuation and development of which in public life can lead to ambiguous or problematic consequences."

A certain institutional stabilization of the family was the result of a turn of policies in support of traditional foundations, including the Church and communal norms of life. The attitudes of large groups of population towards these norms were ambiguous. Church\u2019s role was pre\u2011 served in everyday life of the Soviet people: in baptisms, weddings, celebrating religious holidays, etc. The manifestations of the patriarchal forms of family were combined with new Soviet realities \u2014 the growth of women\u2019s employment, the emergence of new social institutions during the New Economic Policy (NEP). The period was thus the initial stage in the transformation of Russian classical patriarchal family into a Soviet patriarchal family."

For each of these meetings, the authors give the names of the major protagonists within the imperial elite: officials, Church leaders, Orientalists/ethnographers, and then a short sketch of topics discussed. The conclusion is that over these ten years, the discourse became tougher, and switched from the discussion of religious freedom and Muslim education, to a direct search of the ways of containing the growing Muslim political intelligentsia. This trend culminated in an anti\u2011Jadid policies and the turn towards \u201ctraditionalism\u201d (keeping the Russian language and secular subjects out of the maktabs and madrasas; stopping the influx of foreign Islamic preachers, etc.)."

The aim is to reconstruct a specific understanding of the Holy Scripture by the people, who were for a long time cut off from any connection with Christianity. The text represents a mixture of various traditions and motifs, some of which are taken from the Holy Scripture and West\u2011 ern medieval Christian legends or borrowed from Japanese myths and folk tales, and some were made up by Japanese believers them\u2011 selves. Tenchi Hajimari-no Koto reinterprets in a \u201cJapanese\u201d way the main Christian doctrines concerning the nature of God and the Holy Trinity, or the meaning of the Atonement. On one hand, the story becomes, indeed, more \u201cJapanese,\u201d on the other \u2014 it creates its own specific language and semiotic system, its own faith, not purely Christian or purely Japanese, which can be fully understood only by a narrow circle of \u201cthe chosen.\u201d"

The author considers two texts, which, in his opinion, belong to F.

Mennonites, being marginal groups in both the USSR and in North America, beneited from luctuations of the Soviet political course toward religion. Using the connections to the Evangelical Baptists, the North American Mennonites managed to establish irst contacts with their brethren who at that moment were released from their deportation status and gained freedom of \u00a0settlement. The North American Mennonites did not achieve their primary goal of complete recognition of the Soviet Mennonites but they managed to raise their political status and succeeded in positioning them as a confession that should be regarded alongside other legal confessions."

            "Abstract": "The World Council of Churches, as well as the ecumenical movement as a whole, were severely criticized after the fall of the \u201cIron curtain\u201d. On the one hand, this organization was accused of loyal politics towards the socialist countries and neglecting the restrictions of religious freedoms. On the other hand, it was accused of active participation in the loss of theological identity of Churches with ancient traditions. This article analyses the development of the World Council of Churches, the change of its theological and social doctrines in the context of ideological opposition between two political blocks, active processes of decolonization in the South and secularization in the West. The author ofers an analysis from inside \u2014 \u00a0this helps to understand the values of its leaders, the logic of their actions, the mechanisms of planning and decision\u2011making. Gradual shift of attention of \u00a0the World Council of Churches in the 1960s to the Third World led to the shift of the theological paradigm of ecumenical movement: now it was more about theology of liberation and emphasis on the image of the \u201cChurch for the poor\u201d. This shift created more opportunities for dialogue with representatives of Churches from the socialist camp."

This propaganda was also a response to the use of religion as an instrument of the Cold War by the Western countries as \u201cthe sword of the spirit and the shield of faith\u201d (A. Preston)."

            "Abstract": "In 1969, Anglican priest Michael Bourdeaux and his colleagues established the Centre for the Study of Religion and Communism (CSRC) \u2014 \u00a0later Keston College \u2014 \u00a0which is often mentioned as playing an important role in drawing attention to religious believers in the Soviet Union. Yet, its role has thus far not been analyzed extensively. This article considers the role played by Bourdeaux and his colleagues on the \u201creligious front\u201d of the Cold War, both before the establishment of the CSRC and in its early years. A historical contextual analysis of \u00a0Bourdeaux\u2019s portrayals of internal church conlicts in the USSR in the \u00a01960s indicates that his work occasionally reinforced a dichotomous conception of the Soviet Christian \u2018other\u2019 as either suferer or collaborator. The article argues that from 1959 to 1975, an ever increasing westward low of Soviet samizdat from religious believers allowed Bourdeaux and his organization to disseminate largely ccurate information about human rights violations in the Soviet Union to a wide audience of journalists, scholars, and Christian churches in the West."

Examining this topic, the author describes a new form of ecumenical activity associated with the emergence of conservative Christian alliances in defense of traditional values. This \u201cconservative ecumenism\u201d, or \u201cEcumenism 2.0,\u201d difers from the \u201cclassical ecumenism\u201d that arose in the early 20th century and is represented today by the World Council of Churches and other ecumenical structures. The author considers the phenomenon of \u201cecumenical consciousness\u201d and shows that it can be found in both types of ecumenism; however, some of the Orthodox anti\u2011ecumenists who attack the \u201cclassical\u201d ecumenism may eagerly opt for this new, conservative \u201cEcumenism 2.0\u201d.

According to\u00a0the basic historiographical narrative, the humiliation of\u00a0saints officially practiced by\u00a0medieval monks and canons was prohibited by\u00a0the Second Council of\u00a0Lyon in\u00a01274, leading to\u00a0the gradual marginalization of\u00a0this devotional \u00abinstrument.\u00bb Nevertheless, exempla that presented the coercion of\u00a0saints as\u00a0a\u00a0legitimate (although radical) method of\u00a0communication with supernatural powers continued to\u00a0appear in\u00a0collections for preachers even in\u00a0the Counter\u2011Reformation period. At\u00a0the same time, by\u00a0the late Middle Ages and the Early Modern period, these practices had been gradually reinterpreted as\u00a0superstition and/or blasphemy (sacrilege). This transformation is\u00a0due to\u00a0two interdependent agendas: the growing delegitimization and even demonization of\u00a0popular religion by\u00a0Church intellectuals and prelates, and the Protestant iconoclasm of\u00a0the 16th and 17th centuries, which made the ecclesiastical authorities, who were anxious to\u00a0protect the core of\u00a0the traditional faith, much more sensitive to\u00a0any form of\u00a0irreverence or\u00a0deviance toward statues or\u00a0other images of\u00a0saints."

This study focuses on\u00a0the borderline infringements that involved subversive words and gestures that caught the attention of\u00a0the authorities, even though they could have been easily overlooked. A\u00a0priest who made a\u00a0lame joke about the altar, or\u00a0a\u00a0simple worker who played a\u00a0lute instead of\u00a0listening to\u00a0the clerics, was accused of\u00a0blasphemy and sacrilege. At\u00a0the same time more outrageous gestures (in\u00a0terms of\u00a0our modern sensibility), such as\u00a0dancing in\u00a0the church with a\u00a0dead body, were not punished. It\u00a0would be\u00a0easy to\u00a0dismiss this incongruity as\u00a0a\u00a0quirk of\u00a0the juridical and social system (the dance involved a\u00a0noblemen and thus was treated diferently). Yet the relative insigniicance of\u00a0such cases provides useful insights into how blasphemy and sacrilege were perceived by\u00a0the church and state authorities and by\u00a0the general population. It\u00a0would be\u00a0simplistic to\u00a0equate this perception with petty vindictiveness or\u00a0superstition: both motivations should be\u00a0acknowledged but viewed within the broader context of\u00a0the Reformation."

He\u00a0tries to\u00a0answer three overlapping questions: how the Inquisition and secular courts coordinated their activities in\u00a0response to\u00a0this broad field of\u00a0jurisdiction; how different forms of\u00a0blasphemous sayings and actions correlated with religious scepticism and the theoretical elaboration of\u00a0unbelief; and how in\u00a0society, where disrespectful words and gestures toward sacred persons and objects were part of\u00a0everyday life, the Church tried on\u00a0the one hand to\u00a0eradicate blasphemy, and on\u00a0the other hand to\u00a0reconcile itself with blasphemy\u2019s ingrained existence."

            "Abstract": "In\u00a0the eighteenth century Malta was a\u00a0hub of\u00a0maritime activity and many powers wanted to\u00a0gain influence over the island state. Its fortiications, dockyards and facilities were strategically placed in\u00a0the center of\u00a0the Mediterranean. The island was home to\u00a0the knights of\u00a0St. John, upheld on\u00a0the island by\u00a0a\u00a0cosmopolitan array of\u00a0merchants, mercenaries, inquisitors and corsairs. The latter two categories are the focus of\u00a0this study. The inquisitors in\u00a0Malta represented the Holy See. They were the personal representatives of\u00a0His Holiness on\u00a0Malta. They guided the Catholic lock against the Reformation. By\u00a0the eighteenth century this work had turned to\u00a0other more mundane efforts, such as\u00a0protecting the people from witchcraft, heresy, sodomy and blasphemy, among other things. In\u00a0the two cases brought forward in\u00a0our paper we\u00a0analyze the trials of\u00a0two corsairs. One was a\u00a0simple cabin boy while the other was a\u00a0famous corsair captain, who in\u00a0his prime had sent shockwaves around the Mediterranean. He\u00a0had been a\u00a0slave of\u00a0the Ottoman sultan and through sheer bravery and determination led a\u00a0mutiny aboard the lagship of\u00a0the Ottoman navy. He\u00a0captured the ship, sailed to\u00a0Malta, and started a\u00a0career as\u00a0a\u00a0corsair that would see him one of\u00a0the most feared men of\u00a0the middle sea."

            "Abstract": "The article discusses the origins, content, and meaning of\u00a0two editions of\u00a0the New Testament constructed by\u00a0Thomas Jefferson in\u00a01804 and 1819. He\u00a0had launched these editions in\u00a0accordance with his views on\u00a0the interrelatedness of\u00a0religion and reason, of\u00a0the freedom of\u00a0conscience, and the right to\u00a0interpret the New Testament through the prism of\u00a0one\u2019s own life experience. The article analyses the sources of\u00a0Jefferson\u2019s perception of\u00a0Christianity, the influence of\u00a0the thinkers of\u00a0the European Enlightenment upon him, as\u00a0well as\u00a0contemporary scholarly research on\u00a0The Jefferson Bible. The author indicates that the religious views of\u00a0Thomas Jefferson remain the subject of\u00a0a\u00a0fierce debate, which expresses a\u00a0variety of\u00a0positions: from labeling him as\u00a0an\u00a0atheist to\u00a0imaging him as\u00a0a\u00a0deeply religious person. The intensity of\u00a0these discussions proves that the issue of\u00a0whether Jefferson could be\u00a0regarded a\u00a0Christian and in\u00a0what sense, as\u00a0well as\u00a0what he\u00a0himself meant by\u00a0that, goes far beyond the specifics of\u00a0the historical period of\u00a0the formation of\u00a0the USA. According to\u00a0the author, Jefferson\u2019s interpretation of\u00a0the New Testament is\u00a0a\u00a0remarkable example of\u00a0the conflict between individual and institutional religiosity that manifested itself in\u00a0the Enlightenment and escalates today. Jefferson\u2019s interpretations prove that there are still no\u00a0simple answers to\u00a0the critical inquiry Christianity faced over two centuries ago."

It\u00a0shows that in\u00a0Christianizing subjects\u2019 mythological worldview a\u00a0tsar could play the role of\u00a0a\u00a0demiurge, replacing the pagan creator, and moreover, Russian Buddhists actually included the supreme rulers of\u00a0the Empire in\u00a0the pantheon of\u00a0their faith. The government encouraged the imposition of\u00a0the cult of\u00a0the emperor by\u00a0obliging the clergy of\u00a0non\u2011Christian faiths to\u00a0engage the congregation in\u00a0the celebration of\u00a0national events related to\u00a0the reigning dynasty (which also had religious overtones).

Christianization of\u00a0Buryats as\u00a0well as\u00a0other non\u2011Russians in\u00a0the remote regions of\u00a0Russia seemed a\u00a0necessary tool for strengthening the borders of\u00a0the empire, which were under threat from Qing China. While Christianization of\u00a0Pre\u2011Baikal (Western) Buryats\u2011shamanists was quite successful at\u00a0least formally, the Trans\u2011Baikal Buryats remained largely steadfast Buddhists. Considering this fact, the secular authorities built relationships with the Buddhist clergy within the framework of\u00a0the existing legal regulations. However, the relationship between Orthodoxy and Buddhism was irreconcilable overall in\u00a0imperial history. The situation worsened at\u00a0the end of\u00a0the nineteenth century, when in\u00a0connection with the Buryat ethnonational movements, Buddhism began to\u00a0spread among the Western Buryats. This caused serious problems in\u00a0Irkutsk eparchy, where they believed that only Orthodoxy could ensure loyalty to\u00a0the monarchy and the Empire. Meanwhile, loyalty to\u00a0the state, including the deification of\u00a0the monarch, was an\u00a0inherent characteristic of\u00a0Buddhism both abroad and in\u00a0Russia. In\u00a0addition to\u00a0a\u00a0strong adaptive ability, institutionalized Buddhism in\u00a0Russia developed adoration and devotion to\u00a0the Tsar among Buryats through appropriate preaching to\u00a0believers, thus promoting and strengthening both its own position and the Russian identity of\u00a0the Buryats."

Unlike traditional eternalism, which treats the being of\u00a0God in\u00a0terms of\u00a0time transcendence, i.\u00a0e., timelessness and the absence of\u00a0duration, temporalism assumes the existence of\u00a0God in\u00a0the past, present and future, i.\u00a0e., His principal temporality. Despite the fact that the idea of\u00a0divine eternity as\u00a0transcendence is\u00a0traditionally viewed as\u00a0an\u00a0integral part of\u00a0Christian doctrine, key proponents of\u00a0temporalism\u00a0\u2014 Nicholas Wolterstorff, Richard Swinburne, and Anthony Kenny\u00a0\u2014 sought to\u00a0prove, first, eternalism\u2019s origins in\u00a0pagan Greek philosophy that is\u00a0alien to\u00a0Christianity; second, the incompatibility of\u00a0the traditional concept of\u00a0eternity with the fundamental form of\u00a0biblical thought; finally, strict rationality, and hence better compatibility of\u00a0temporalism with the achievements of\u00a0contemporary philosophy.

Different attitudes toward this concept are compared, resulting in the conclusion that any valid assessment requires a definition of reformation as a religious and social process that can exist outside the specific period of the Protestant Reformation. Delineation of the general characteristics of reformation makes it possible to demonstrate that current tendencies in the Islamic world are similar to those occurring during the Reformation and that Islamic fundamentalists are the driving force of this new reformation. This means that it is incorrect to assess their values and their influence as archaic, reactionary, or fascist. The worldview of Islamic fundamentalists contains both modernizing and anti-modernizing features, and some elements of their influence on society are of a modernizing nature."

This theory, mediated by Western modernization theory, claims a comprehensive understanding of Islamic reality and thus attracts many researchers. However, this universality results in a lack of attention to some important areas, which stimulates criticism from experts on Islam. The aim of this article is to identify and characterize the main approaches to understanding the phenomenon of \u201cIslamic reformation.\u201d There are three different groups of researchers who accept the concept\u2019s validity, among whom there is no unity regarding its content. The first group talks about \u201cIslamic reformation\u201d as a positive political program, while the second connects it exclusively with the negative phenomenon of Islamic radicalism. The third group does not engage in polemics about \u201cIslamic reformation,\u201d but rather consistently seeks to prove the concept\u2019s inadequacy in explaining Islamic realities and to offer alternative research models. A detailed consideration of a number of works demonstrates several different approaches within one discourse on \u201cIslamic reformation\u201d."

According to Neomodernism theory, contemporary human society is at the point of transferring from the postmodern stage to a new one. This stage is characterized by the combination of three elements: the need for a new positive message, the archaic content of this message, and the use of postmodern tools to construct it. The religious factor plays a special and very important role in the socio-political process, which can be discovered by means of secular and post-secular ideas. After making some general observations the author tries to apply them to Middle Eastern reality and Arab-Muslim culture. As a result he outlines the principal traits of \u201cIslamic secularism\u201d and reveals the common post-secular trends of Middle Eastern and Western society. At the end of the article the author analyzes links between Neomodernism and post-secularism at the regional and global levels."

Studies of the late imperial period typically devote the majority of their attention to modernization. Jadidists-reformers are considered as key protagonists and engines of history. A typical narrative about Jadidists includes several elements: political activity, reforms in education, the flourishing of journalism, the renewal of religion and the \u201cwomen\u2019s question.\u201d In this article we consider Jadidism as a story about backwardness and progress, which is uncritically reproduced in academic literature. Relying on recollections of Gubdulla Bubi, we offer a reconsideration of the framework that is generally used to describe the intellectual history of Muslims in Russia. We classify Bubi\u2019s narrative as language-ideology and place it within the framework of our own \u201cimperial project\u201d. We do so in order to offer an alternative to Jadidim as an explanatory model."

            "Abstract": "The movement of Muslim reformism appeared in Dagestan in the early twentieth century. The reformers aimed to develop Islamic thought and law in line with the new realities. There were three forms of this movement. The first group of scholars proposed reforming only the Islamic educational system, while supporting the tradition of the Shafi\u2019i legal school. The second party of reformers went further and advocated expanding the framework of the Shafi\u2019i legal school as well as the reform of education. The third group of reformers proposed reform of the system of Islamic education, criticized the legal schools, and called for independent judgments on the matter of Islamic law beyond the framework of the legal schools. Sufism also was the object of harsh criticism by the reformists of the second and third group. For this reason, the imperial and later the Soviet authorities supported the reform movement in Dagestan. Reformers, with their rational approach to Islam and to education, emerged as one of the Bolsheviks\u2019 major partners and were incorporated into the Soviet educational system. This ended in the 1930s during the Red Terror when many prominent reformers were executed or sent into exile. Still, the reformers\u2019 ideas survived. Their critique of Sufism and Islamic legal schools was later taken up by the Salafi groups in Dagestan in the post-Soviet period."

Sufis, for example, value obedience, disapprove of violence, and tend to trust people. Salafis are more conservative in terms of gender, more prone toward justification of violence, and trust people less, while secular Muslims support liberal values and universalism. The analysis of violence justification determinants showed that along with gender, age, and strength of religiosity, the factors that influence this phenomenon are participation in Salafi social circles and level of happiness, security, and trust. Each of these factors relates to the explanation of various forms of violence justification differently."

Some of them considered fundamentalism as potentially a modernist movement, and others saw it only as antimodernist and archaic. In this respect, the question of balance between declared goals and real impact on social development was raised, in other words, can those groups that call for a return to the past in reality facilitate movement forward? Much attention was paid to terminology. There was also an active discussion on the issue of language for scientific analysis and the language of self-presentation of different Islamic movements, and whether they should be interconnected or could be fully autonomous."

This traditional understanding is connected with the loss of the initial creative impulse of early Islam, with the so-called closure of the gate of ijtihad. Both the fundamentalists and the reformist typically reference the early Islamic period. But the question is, why do they do so? Is it in order to find ready-made answers or to find the inner sense of this or that statement, to liberate them from historical limits and discover how to realize them in modern life? T. Ibrahim thinks that there is no clash of Western and Isalmic civilizations but there are clashes between traditional and modern values within civilizations. His view is that in Muslim countries the modernization of the society without religious reform, as took place in Turkey, is not able to protect society from setbacks as long as the traditional understanding of religion remains untouched. And such radical organizations as DAISH exploit this situation. In the reformation of Islam T. Ibrahim underlines the special role of the Islamic periphery, mostly Europe, and also including Russia."

But as a result of social progress leading to the marginalization of a huge portion of the Islamic religious community due to the loss of political representation after the Islamic caliphate was destroyed, the search for the new forms of such representation is in progress. This search takes place in different forms, and it is accompanied by violence as it presupposes radical political shifts. The same thing occurred in the other similar situations, for example in the course of the Protestant Reformation, and in implementation of the communist project. Orkhan did not connect the current situation in Islam with migration from Muslim states to the West (he explained the problems that arose here by the crisis of Europe itself). At the same time, he thinks that one of the forms of Islamic expansion should be the development of a model of life for everyone (including non-Muslims) that is characterized by serious moral superiority compared to the current Western way of life."

The author puts forward the hypothesis that the sun as a conceptual metaphor accumulates meanings, notions, and intuitions that are later attributed to the sacred and are finally inscribed in its composition. Among the probable points of intersection the following concepts are considered: the ambivalence of the sacred, loss of subjectivity as religion\u2019s main point, the unreal, the monstrous, the opposition of heterogeneous/homogeneous, violence, death, etc. The conclusion is drawn that the sun expresses the human being\u2019s violent transition to another state, which could be associated with the opposite side of reality, i.e. with the sacred. The author also analyzes the role of this image in Bataille\u2019s epistemology, which interprets cognition as religious ecstasy and the destruction of the subject-object relation with its object in favor of identification with it. Toward the end of the article the image of the sun\u2019s place in the philosopher\u2019s later work is considered, and it is concluded that it is inscribed in the structure of the sacred via the concepts of sacrifice and expenditure."

            "Abstract": "Based on church documents and eyewitnesses\u2019 memories, the author attempts to present how the Stalin\u2019s \u201cNew Course\u201d religious policy influenced church life under German occupation within Leningrad region from 1943 to 1944. The reinstatement of the Moscow patriarchate and the growing legality of the Russian Orthodox Church allowed the Soviet government to employ the religious factor in its solution to burning political issues. This was especially true within national outlying districts that were not included in the USSR till 1940. His conclusions about the New Course\u2019s negative affect on church life across the occupied Baltic, Ukrainian and Belorussian territories are also relevant to the situation in the districts of the occupied Leningrad region. The opportunities that opened up due to the \u201cNew Course\u201d allowed the Soviet government to strengthen its position even before the liberation of these territories. This happened both through propaganda and church and canonical discrediting of collaborating Orthodox clergy and bishops, as well as through pressure on the church administration by the Soviet intelligence agency. Along with that, drastic measures were taken to eliminate the most opposed and implacable people, like the exarch Sergiy Voskresensky, for example, who was murdered."

The implementation of\u00a0the educational concept outlined in\u00a0the \u00abToledo Guiding Principles on\u00a0Teaching about Religions and Beliefs in\u00a0Public Schools\u00bb (2007) has been the subject of\u00a0a\u00a0vivid international discussion. Supporters of\u00a0the new approach to\u00a0teaching religion hope that the lessons of\u00a0modern religious and non-religious beliefs and practices will promote tolerance and mutual understanding. Critics question not only the methods, but even the goal of\u00a0the new educational strategy: the achievement of\u00a0social peace in\u00a0modern complex societies through the lessons of\u00a0religion. Despite the fact that the context is\u00a0fundamentally different from Western countries, the appearance of\u00a0religious lessons in\u00a0Russian school raises similar questions. What are the goals of\u00a0the course on\u00a0religion: indoctrination or\u00a0the acquisition of\u00a0knowledge? How does pedagogical theory and practice ensure the neutrality or\u00a0engagement of\u00a0teaching religion in\u00a0school?"

            "Abstract": "School courses in\u00a0the basics of\u00a0religious cultures introduced recently into the Russian federal curriculum raise many questions: how and in\u00a0what way religion can be\u00a0taught in\u00a0secular school; whether the course should be\u00a0monoconfessional or\u00a0based on\u00a0comparative religious studies; what its goal should be\u00a0teaching about religion or\u00a0an\u00a0invitation to\u00a0religion; whether the course should be\u00a0chosen with respect to\u00a0ethnic background or\u00a0whether it\u00a0can be\u00a0optional; whether it\u00a0should be\u00a0a\u00a0short course or\u00a0an\u00a0extensive one covering the entire educational period; what the content of\u00a0the textbooks should\u00a0be; and precisely what values should be\u00a0discussed and what the results of\u00a0such an\u00a0education should\u00a0be. This article analyzes new textbooks covering the basics of\u00a0Christian, Muslim, and Jewish cultures. It\u00a0is\u00a0shown that in\u00a0contrast to\u00a0their declared emphasis on\u00a0culture, many textbooks invite users into religion. The author argues that the textbooks in\u00a0\u00abFoundations of\u00a0Orthodox Culture\u00bb are closer to\u00a0indoctrination than textbooks in\u00a0other religious cultures. This is\u00a0a\u00a0result of\u00a0stricter control of\u00a0the ROC over the whole process. Indeed, nowadays the ROC is\u00a0more interested in\u00a0a\u00a0growth in\u00a0the number of\u00a0believers than in\u00a0churches, whereas the Muslims badly need mosques rather than new believers."

The study shows that the main factor of\u00a0a\u00a0particular model of\u00a0religious education in\u00a0Tatarstan is\u00a0its multi-ethnic and multi-religious composition. As\u00a0a\u00a0result, only two \u00abmodules\u00bb are being used in\u00a0the public schools\u00a0\u2014 World Religious Cultures and Secular Ethics, while the four other \u00abmodules\u00bb linked to\u00a0particular religions remain outside the public schools.

Analysis of\u00a0the Hebrew text suggests that the \u00abapophatic\u00bb reading reflects the original understanding of\u00a0Exodus\u00a03:14 in\u00a0its pre-Hellenistic context. The Septuagint rendering of\u00a0the Hebrew text is\u00a0often regarded as\u00a0influenced by\u00a0Greek philosophy, but it\u00a0may well be\u00a0explained as\u00a0a\u00a0translator\u2019s attempt to\u00a0deal with the difficult text, namely to\u00a0retain the parallelism between two halves of\u00a0verse Exodus\u00a03:14 without violating the norms of\u00a0the Greek grammar. If\u00a0this is\u00a0the case, the LXX translators did not invent the \u00abontological\u00bb understanding of\u00a0this verse, but rather involuntarily prepared the way for\u00a0it."

The origins of\u00a0the understanding of\u00a0\u00abgnosis\u00bb as\u00a0a\u00a0special form of\u00a0spiritual experience is\u00a0related to\u00a0non-traditional religiosity connected with the works of\u00a0the members of\u00a0the Eranos circle (H-C.

            "Abstract": "This article analyzes problems of\u00a0preservation and reproduction of\u00a0religious tradition in\u00a0modern society using the example of\u00a0Russian Orthodoxy. The author uses the apparatus of\u00a0the phenomenological philosophy of\u00a0A.\u00a0Schutz to\u00a0analyze the translation of\u00a0\u00abhigh\u00bb forms of\u00a0tradition. P.\u00a0Bourdieu\u2019s concept of\u00a0habitus is\u00a0used to\u00a0describe the mechanism of\u00a0the transmission of\u00a0tradition in\u00a0its \u00abpopular\u00bb manifestation. In\u00a0the first case, the transfer of\u00a0the semantic content of\u00a0the tradition is\u00a0realized under the conditions of\u00a0the We-relationship in\u00a0the immediate environment, where people are able to\u00a0understand each other in\u00a0the best possible way. In\u00a0the second case, the concept of\u00a0habitus allows\u00a0us to\u00a0describe how the tradition that has been developing for a\u00a0long time within the community of\u00a0believers remains at\u00a0the level of\u00a0practice, often not reaching the level of\u00a0discourse and consciousness. Thus, a\u00a0community of\u00a0believers has various options for understanding and preserving the tradition: from attempts to\u00a0penetrate the sense of\u00a0the cultural heritage left by\u00a0predecessors and to\u00a0follow it\u00a0today, to\u00a0the preservation of\u00a0the external manifestations of\u00a0faith and the practices it\u00a0presupposes in\u00a0unchanged form. Therefore, religious tradition now appears in\u00a0a\u00a0variety of\u00a0forms."

            "Abstract": "This article looks at\u00a0the origins of\u00a0phenomenological investigations into the problem of\u00a0religion. Reinach\u2019s Aufzeichnungen drew the attention of\u00a0G\u00f6ttingen phenomenologists toward religious experience; at\u00a0the same time the philosophical discussion was accompanied by\u00a0the active interest of\u00a0Husserl\u2019s students in\u00a0Christianity. This article summarizes psychological research into the problem of\u00a0religious conversion before reconstructing the history of\u00a0phenomenological religiosity. The \u00abdemocratization\u00bb of\u00a0interest in\u00a0the study of\u00a0religion and the search for a\u00a0universal explanatory theory led to\u00a0a\u00a0situation in\u00a0which psychologists of\u00a0religion lost sight of\u00a0the phenomenon of\u00a0\u00abreligious awakening\u00bb among philosophers. But the dual nature of\u00a0the phenomenon as\u00a0a\u00a0collective process that at\u00a0the same time was an\u00a0object of\u00a0intellectual reflection raises interesting questions about the possible role of\u00a0academicians in\u00a0transforming religious meanings within a\u00a0tradition. This question leads to\u00a0an\u00a0exploration of\u00a0the relationship of\u00a0the phenomenon to\u00a0the phenomenological project as\u00a0a\u00a0whole. In\u00a0the final analysis, it\u00a0becomes possible to\u00a0point out some questions about theories of\u00a0religious conversion and to\u00a0find a\u00a0new way of\u00a0problematizing the history of\u00a0the phenomenological movement."

Five analytical approaches were defined: historical, sociological, spatial, theological, and economic. In\u00a0the historical approach, a\u00a0church building is\u00a0taken by\u00a0itself, with no\u00a0active relation to\u00a0the social environment. In\u00a0the sociological approach, the social processes around the church become central. The theological approach is\u00a0similar, but here the focus is\u00a0on\u00a0the spiritual dimension of\u00a0church activities. Spatial characteristics of\u00a0the church building and its environment are central for the approach we\u00a0call spatial. The last approach deals with the church economy as\u00a0a\u00a0part of\u00a0urban economic life. The presence of\u00a0a\u00a0church is\u00a0an\u00a0absolute necessity for Christians, and research into templelike structures must be\u00a0complex and combine all various approaches."

The meaning of councils is not limited to their agenda. The primary source of their charisma is the fact of assembly as such. The conciliar assembly manifests the essential relationships on which the Church is founded. One of the author\u2019s chief concerns is to describe how councils help to shape the dynamics of leadership in the Christian Church. The orientation of conciliar leadership is horizontal and inclusive, not vertical and elitist. Councils are nodes of a network, not components of a pyramid. The history of councils is long and complex. A summary of that history is not the aim of this essay. Certain crucial moments in conciliar history are mentioned because they remain enduring reference points for the Church\u2019s conciliar practice even today. Among the historical moments considered here are the origin of councils, the relation of councils to \u201ccatholicism,\u201d the legacy of the Ecumenical Councils, the Great Eastern Schism, the significance of medieval Western conciliar practice for the wider Church, and the renewal of conciliar practice in modern times."

            "Abstract": "The author considers All-Russian Church Council of 1917 \u2013 1918th as a special phenomenon of the conciliar practice of the Orthodox Church. He analyses the composition and arrangement of the Council in its historical context, paying particular attention to the role of the laity and bishops. A strong representation of laity allowed to avoid the conflict between married and monastic clergy. In addition, this system of representation was the visible realization of the idea of sobornost\u2019, which the Council of 1917 \u2013 1918th considered to be essential to restore. Thus, it built a balance between the principle of sobornost\u2019 and the Church as hierarchy based upon the principle of apostolicity. The latter was implemented by the special role played by the bishops\u2019 meeting, which acted as dogmatic and canonical \u201cfilter\u201d, testing the decisions, adopted at the Council. The article then explores the previsions for the future All-Russian local councils which were supposed to undergo important changes in composition and functions."

The author firstly defines the current meaning of church \u201cautocephalous\u201d status and then creates a typology of the Orthodox ecclesiastical subjects drawing upon history, current situation, and structural features. The paper concludes that any strict typology is impossible to develop, while the differences in particular aspects would not help to represent the configuration of the entire Orthodox commonwealth. Instead, the paper develops grouping by certain paradigms: national/transnational; anachronic/diachronic, national/imperial. Also, the paper introduces a new paradigm of a \u201cdiffused church\u201d that overlaps with the above paradigms. The paper then deals with the distinction between the \u201csymbolic\u201d and the \u201creal\u201d aspects of church constitution and church self-perception."

            "Abstract": "The Orthodox Church is a complex geopolitical reality, and it does not constitute a homogenous block. On the contrary, the rise of irredentism during the 19th century has created the basis for constant territorial fragmentation throughout the 20th century. Surprisingly, the worldwide Orthodox population continues to increase. The convergence of these two phenomena is a starting point for a reinvestigation of Orthodox power in international affairs, as well as a profound strategic change affecting the communion of the fourteen local Orthodox Churches. This article examines how Orthodoxy, through the process of convening a Holy and Great Council, has responded to geopolitics by developing new approaches and new Orthodoxy identities; how the territorial changes affected their strategies in the Diaspora; what was their role in new international conflicts. The first part of the article deals with an epistemological approach to place Orthodoxy in the context of geopolitical studies, while the second part highlights the persistence of a bipolar paradigm opposing the Patriarchates of Constantinople and Moscow. Finally, the paper considers geopolitical challenges for Orthodoxy created by today\u2019s politico-religious crisis in Syria."

This article describes distinctive features and main events of the pre-conciliar process at its different stages as well as retraces the formation of the Council\u2019s agenda and the evolution of its preparatory procedure. The article demonstrates that relations between the local churches, especially those of the Ecumenical and Moscow Patriarchates, have affected the character and intensity of the pre-conciliar process. The author concludes that the preparatory methodology developed in the second half of the 20th century became inefficient in the early 21st century. The reconsideration of the accepted procedure made it possible for the churches to agree upon convening the Council in 2016. Yet we can presume that another Council will be necessary to consider a few items removed from the agenda of the upcoming Council."

The author points to the thematic parallelism of the two conciliar processes, which reflected the desire of the Catholic and Orthodox churches to respond to the challenges of contemporary world. At the same time, in contrast to the Catholic Council, in the Orthodox pre-consiliar many of the themes of the original agenda, concerning the relationship of the Church to the modern world, have been omitted after long discussions; some themes were not supported and dropped at the Pre-Council meetings. As a result, the agenda scheduled for June 2016 Pan-Orthodox Council became largely limited to internal church issues, except for one document \u2014 about the Mission of the Church."

The author shows that the calendar and paschal issues were repeatedly placed on the church agenda with different emphases: the desire for a common date for Easter in the first millennium; confessional differences after the Gregorian reform in the 16th century; and the search for a pan-Orthodox response to the changed socio-political conditions of the 20th \u2013 21st centuries. None of these efforts offered a fast, implementable, and commonly acceptable \u201cformula\u201d for solving the issue. The conciliar process has always played an important role in achieving unity and was an important counterweight to attempts at imposing a particular model \u201cfrom above\u201d. The starting point for the considered discussions was liturgical variety, whose legitimate existence (not just in relation to the calendar and Easter tables) does not divide the Church, but, on the contrary, reveals its inner unity in the variety of liturgical forms. In this regard, the study of the calendar and paschal issues in the broader context of achieving and maintaining Church unity can contribute to the successful solution of other issues on the agenda of the forthcoming Pan-Orthodox Council."

The author then examines the issue of primacy in the Universal Church. All these questions can be combined and connected with the issue of the supreme or sovereign power in the Orthodox Church: its localization and mechanics for the implementation. The author examines content and essence of each issue, main approaches to their solution and attempts to reconcile them within the framework of the pre-conciliar discussions. The analysis reveals two ecclesiological models of the Orthodox Church structure and two approaches to understanding the sovereign power. These two models can be described by formulas: \u201cfirst without equal\u201d and \u201cequal without the first\u201d. The first model confers supreme power on Ecumenical Patriarch who is the \u201cfirst in honor.\u201d The second one insists on the fundamental equality of the autocephalous local churches and regards them as ecclesial sovereigns. The incompatibility of these models is the main cause of failure of all attempts to solve controversial issues within the pre-conciliar process."

The Russian imperial idea was strongly influenced by the idea of Orthodox oikumene, first shaped in Byzantium. In the 19th century the idea of translatio imperii was further modified first by the Slavophils, and later by the Russian national ideology under Alexander III. The neo-Byzantinism of the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century accepted the idea of the Third Rome and became the basis of Russian policy in the Near East. Support of the Orthodox population of the Balkans and the Near East, a creation of a confederation of Orthodox states under the guidance of Russia, and finally restoration of the Russian Patriarchate, \u2014 all these were considered as chains of one line, the restoration of the ideal Christian kingdom. In the Balkans, Russian universalism faced a similar idea of the restoration of the Greek empire, as well as the growing Balkan nationalism. The struggle of the two \u201cgreat ideas\u201d took place in the frames of the Eastern Question \u2014 the rivalry of the great powers for spheres of influence in the Balkans and the Near East. Finally it brought the beginning of the First World War."

He proves that this right never exclusively belonged to the Patriarch of Constantinople, technically the first among equals, and this was accepted by some among Greeks. The attempt to grant this right to the Patriarch of Constantinople stems from the situation shaped just after the fall of the Russian Empire when a battle for primacy started to unfold. On the other hand, the idea of a collective convocation of a future Pan-Orthodox Council developed during the first half of the twentieth century. In spite of this, representatives of the Orthodox Churches agreed in 1968 that the right to convoke the hypothetical council did indeed belong to the Patriarch of Constantinople but always with prior agreement of the chief hierarchs of other autocephalous churches. The author shows that this decision was reached as a type of temporary compromise solution rather than a logical conclusion of previous discussions."

In the situation of a strong Church discord in Russia, provoked by anti-religious policy of the Bolsheviks, the Patriarchate of Constantinople claimed the role of mediator between the Russian Church (\u201cTikhonovskaia\u201d) and the Pro-Soviet Renovationist schism. The Ecumenical Patriarchate tried to collaborate with Soviet authorities in attempts to unify \u201cTikhonites\u201d and renovators so that they could participate at the prospected Ecumenical Council. However, the transition of Russian Western European parishes to Constantinople in 1931 caused strong negative reaction from both the Russian Church and Soviet authorities. Finally, the Soviet leadership did not authorize a united delegation to take part at the Inter-Orthodox Pre-Council meeting (Prosynod). The absence of the Russian Church made both Prosynod and the Ecumenical Council impossible."

The hope is that this question will not be driven by the psycho-dynamics of self-identification vis-\u00e0vis the proximate other, and that theology could serve a critical tool that challenges the Church to be the Church."

Maria Yasynia is seen to be of Alanian (Ossetian) origin, and hence the great interest to her personality among Orthodox activists in today\u2019s North Ossetia-Alania, as well as among some people from local government and Moscow ecclesiastical establishment. Analyzing the debates around this initiative allows for some conclusions about current understanding of the nature of saintliness. The question is: who and on what grounds could be a legitimate expert in the field of applied hagiology? Determining hagiological dignity of a candidate for sainthood cannot be reduced to the confrontation between Orthodox Church \u201celite\u201d and the \u201cmasses,\u201d or between diocesan center and periphery. Each group tries to use the potential of the saint\u2019s image to achieve its own goals, while possibly avoiding confrontation with others. Overall, the debates over the canonization produce the most important symbols of national and regional identities, which go beyond the internal life of the Church."

Akadak as Lidzava annual praying ritual has been one of the last festivities in the whole Abkhazia, which continued to integrate not a few\u00a0families but all the villagers. For centuries the lands of Pitsunda peninsula attracted new flows of immigrants, the protection of which was provided by the temple, and later the rural shrine spun off from it. The irony of history is that the melting pot that turned hundreds of strangers into \u201cAbkhazians\u201d, was a hybrid, non-indigenous cult. Akadak praying more and more resembles a ceremony to integrate local community, helping to bring the current project of Abkhaz nationalism to life."

In addition, the article discusses the attitudes of young people toward the process of secularization. The article measures specific indicators, which, in our opinion, is the best way to identify value orientations of the Georgian youth. The surveys were carried out in 2014 and 2015."

            "Abstract": "In the past two decades, the Orthodox Church of Georgia as an institution has been considerably strengthened, and its influence in the public space has significantly grown. As demonstrated by numerous studies, this is partly due to the link between national and religious identities and to the instrumentalization of religion by political elites. However, the concrete ways in which the public authorities have sought to establish their legitimacy thanks to religious references remain to be scrutinized, as well as the constraints they are subjected to. This article focuses on the games of power and strategies of the Patriarchate and the Government around the construction and reconstruction of two cathedrals, Sameba and Bagrati, and on the challenges of building the symbolic national space. Through the analysis of the attempts of the Saakashvili Government to use the symbolic resources provided by major religious buildings, it sheds some light on the limits of the instrumentalization\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0of Orthodoxy in the legitimization of power."

            "Abstract": "Based on a field study of the Gegharkunik region of Armenia, the research addresses the process of building new churches in the context of contemporary social and economic life of the Armenian\u00a0village. The main characters of the research are initiators and sponsors of the church construction, represented by several social types and, in particular, the type of an affluent emigrant, who thus wants to be represented at their home village with a new status. Building a church usually becomes a social project, through which they construct a positive image of themselves, strengthen the personal and family influence among local authorities and business people, thus becoming a part of the local elites, while being outside physically. Each new church has a \u201clegend\u201d which clarifies motives of the donator referring to such values as his piety, mystical connection to the saints, deference to the memory of ancestors, and compassion to people\u2019s needs. The main places of cult in villages of the region have always been family shrines, usually constructed in a form of a small chapel and devoted to a saint-protector. Newly-constructed church, therefore, eventually takes on functions of such a family shrine, regardless its sizes."

It describes and analyzes various aspects of Islamic business: operation of the halal market, the sector of women\u2019s clothing, advertising strategies. Special attention is given to the issue of the hijab, its symbolic meaning, and its role in women\u2019s social life. The problem of Islamic consumption is viewed through the prism of the commodification of Islam, which affects both religious practices and the local economy. An intensive appeal to Islam in the city\u2019s social and economic space is not so much a sign of Islamic radicalization as it is a choice of cultural references in the society and the quest for new behavioral patterns. The emergence of new consumer attitudes puts before Dagestani society a problem of choice between European standards and a new identity \u2014 belonging to global Islamic civilization. The article draws upon the author\u2019s field materials of 2011-2015."

The analysis of popular narratives, ethnographies and hagiographies clearly shows that the practice of pilgrimage can be seen, among other things, as part of political interests."

His sermons and prophecies became very popular in the early 1990s and still are to this date. The expanding Internet social networks added to his popularity. His name is connected with miraculous healings; his grave became a sort of a modern shrine in the Georgian Orthodox Church. The phenomenon is on the verge between official and popular religion. His name became a source of legitimation for the Church as well as for the political establishment. In 2012 the \u201cstrange monk\u201d was canonized as a saint, in 2014 his body was reburied in the Sameba cathedral in Tbilisi, and an avenue was renamed after him. The whole phenomenon shows the changing and complex role of religion in post-communist Georgian society."

It turns next to those objective and subjective developments in the emerging new societies of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, which seem to contradict the fashionable academic episteme by recreating robust and powerful concepts of ethnos, nation, and religion. Finally, it will suggest a more complex interpretation that would mitigate the above contradiction between dominant academic scholarship and the societal processes."

Islamism allows both men and women to realize strategies, which give them a chance to succeed in situation when role models of their parents stopped functioning.

One of the key elements of this debate is the so-called Born Believers thesis. Here we identify and analyze in detail its underlying assumptions, major components, and argumentation. We also show limitations and weak empirical validity of the alternative to Born Believers thesis hypothesis \u2014 treating religion as the result solely of religious socialization and enculturation. Furthermore, we identify the place of the Born Believers thesis in the context of the wider \u201cinnateness\u201d debate in cognitive sciences. This thesis satisfies the minimum condition of \u201cinnateness\u201d and may serve as a useful heuristic tool in cross-cultural research and in studies of children\u2019s religiosity. At the same time, we demonstrate how the Born Believers thesis reveals the limitations of the cognitive approach to the study\u00a0of religion in solving the problem of \u201cinnateness\u201d of religious beliefs."

            "Abstract": "The article shows a unique place of the Roman Catholic Church in Poland in comparison with other Communist countries of Central-Eastern Europe. During the Second World War, the Catholic Church suffered major personal, material and organisational losses. After the war, the Polish United Workers\u2019 Party conducted an anti-Church and anti-religious policy. Repressions, discrimination, and even murders of priests had been common. However, the communists did not succeed in the secularisation of the country, and the church retained moral authority. Although the teaching of religion in public schools were banned, the religious education was relocated to parishes. The private Catholic University of Lublin also continued its activities. The Catholic press was published despite censorship. The creation of \u201cSolidarity\u201d movement was followed in the 1980s by a boom in church construction. Independent oppositional subculture emerged within the Clubs of Catholic Intellectuals. The development of mass pilgrimages was breaking records at the end of\u00a0the communist rule. This growing authority was partly due to efforts of cardinal Stefan Wyszy\u0144ski, the Primate of Poland, and cardinal Karol Wojty\u0142a, the Pope John Paul II. In the critical moment of change in 1989 the Church served as a mediator and the guarantor of political agreements."

The author traces the history of this myth since 17th century till nowadays. Then one can find analysis of myth\u2019s transformations in Post-Communist period, in particular, in the context of debates about the place of Catholicism and Catholic Church in politics and public sphere. The author shows how this myth divides the Polish society, which leads to a series of conflicts and culture wars between religious conservatives and proponents of secular choice for Poland. In particular, the author analyzes \u201cwars of the cross\u201d after Smolensk plane crash in 2010, phenomenon of \u201cRadio Maria\u201d and the so-called \u201cmohair berets\u201d, emergence of new antireligious political forces (\u201cThe Palikot Movement\u201d). Article concludes that the myth of Catholic Poland continues to play an\u00a0important role in the life of the state, but at the same time it becomes more and more a dividing factor which weakens civil society."

Drawing upon empirical research of \u201cRadio Maryja\u201d and Dominican Order activists, the author uses Pierre Bourdieu\u2019s concepts to show that this cleavage is rooted in social (\u201cclass\u201d) distinctions. \u201cOpen\u201d Catholics have better education; \u201cclosed\u201d Catholics are usually older people with elementary education. Yet these \u00a0distinctions do not affect the capability of people to adapt themselves to new economic realities. Author refutes the existing myth that \u201cclosed\u201d Catholics are passive, lacking dynamism, and relying blindly upon old patterns of behavior. Both groups show similar religious attitudes, and the difference is more about the style of their Christian faith, rather than its content. \u201cOpen\u201d Catholics are more reflective; \u201cclosed\u201d \u2014 more emotional. Finally, the difference is a matter of taste and aesthetical preferences, more than anything else."

Author considers different definitions of agency and shows that it could be interpreted in the way which is different from the one typical to feminist liberal discourse. The article analyzes interconnections between religion and emancipation in Poland, showing that religion does not necessarily imply passivity and restraint. In order to prove this thesis, the author provides examples from empirical research of deeply faithful Catholic women as well as of members of new religious movement \u201cBrahma Kumaris\u201d. The central issue is the ways women, in their practice, interpret the symbolism of maternity and the Virgin Mary."

            "Abstract": "Both meanings and forms of religious imagery have always been influenced by the political and ideological agendas of their time. The article is an exploration in contemporary Catholic imagery in Poland, focusing on its involvement with different expressions of the national. Using the example of the Katy\u0144 Chapel Mausoleum in Warsaw military basilica the article questions the relationship between the image and the relic both in Catholic Christianity, and in the secular modern cult of the nation. It also follows the development of religious iconography related to the Katy\u0144 massacre with a special focus on images of the Madonna, describing in detail two of them, functioning with the same name of Our Lady of Katy\u0144. Following the fate of both images, as well as the way they have been contextualized before and after 1989, the text attempts to trace the changes and modifications of different concepts of the recent Polish past and different politics of history. Comparing the Piet\u00e0 type image of Katy\u0144 Madonna that evolved among Polish Catholics in times of People\u2019s Republic of Poland with the secular Pieta-inspired images of partisans used by the People\u2019s Republic\u2019s regime, it points at differences in their emotional content, relating the differences to the political agendas of the two\u00a0symbolic languages. Finally, it also juxtaposes total absence of triumphalism in the grassroot Katy\u0144-related imagery and the nationalistic triumphalism of glorification of the Katy\u0144 victims in the Katy\u0144 Chapel Mausoleum, where the pierced skull of the major Szyma\u0144ski faces the most modest Katy\u0144 Madonna carved by an inmate of Kozelsk on a wooden board from a camp plank bed."

            "Abstract": "This paper examines a new religious initiative of the Catholic Church in Poland, known as the Extreme Way of the Cross (Ekstremalna Droga Krzy\u017cowa). Launched in 2009 by Fr. Jacek Stryczek, one of the most recognizable Catholic priests in the country, the EDK has been announced as a \u201cnew form of spirituality\u201d. Usually taking place a week before Easter, it is based on a few clear-cut principles: participants are to walk during the night in silence, individually or in small groups, along routes of 30 to 100 km, mostly through forests and fields. On the road, fourteen Stations of the Cross are designated where participants pray and read texts contemplating the Passion of the Christ and its relevance for Christians today. Started as a small-scale event, in just few years EDK has become a nation-wide phenomenon, with more than 200 routes and 26000 registered participants in 2016. The paper examines this apparent success of EDK in the context of (post)modern culture with its focus on bodily movement and embodied experience. In\u00a0particular, the author shows how EDK draws on this modern bias to promote a specific set of religiously motivated values, which combines subordination to the will of God with worldly activism and achievement motivation."

The main emphasis is made upon the sensual relationship of the believers with the sacred and special forms mediating this relationship. The author examines how pilgrimage is organized by special lay guides possessing authority to plan the entire event and lead the groups of pilgrims. Their efforts are focused upon increasing the effect of sensual forms of the sacred. This goal is achieved through optimization of ritual, when some elements are omitted to make space for others. Consequently, not all religious gestures are performed with the same reverence. Such creative changes in the ritual are, however, legitimized within the habitus that rules religious attitudes of the faithful."

            "Abstract": "This article analyses the problematic and debated terminology used specifically within Polish anthropology of religion and proposes new paths more relevant in current transnational and non-binary focused interpretative contexts. In the 1980s, when the anthropological turn in Polish ethnography/ethnology took place, \u00abfolk religiosity\u00bb was the most common term used in anthropological studies on religion within Polish academia (most of these studies focused on Catholicism in a rural setting). This article examines the historical contexts which led to the formation and popularization of this term. It also exposes its limitations and contestations. Other terms used and debated by Polish anthropologists, such as \u00abfolk-type religion\u00bb, \u00abreligious culture\u00bb, \u00abpopular religion\u00bb, are discussed in relation to past and present debates within the Polish anthropology of religion. As a solution to overcoming the obstacles generated by the use of the \u00abfolk religiosity\u00bb concept, the author proposes to introduce the term \u00ablived religion\u00bb. The practical approach of \u00ablived religion\u00bb goes beyond\u00a0\u00abfolk\u00bb \u2014 \u00abelite\u00bb, \u00abnon-official\u00bb \u2014 \u00abofficial\u00bb binaries. Coined within the French sociology of religion (as \u00abreligion v\u00e9cue\u00bb) and since the 1990s popularized in Anglo-Saxon anthropology, the term \u00ablived religion\u00bb reflects new approaches within studies on religion(s). These focus on the practical dimension of religion as well as its materiality and sensuality. Interestingly, all these topics can be also traced in particular studies on Catholicism by Polish researchers."

Theology as educational subject appeared not as the project suggested by religious organizations, but rather as an initiative of the state educational bodies and the institutions of higher education as the result of the institutional collapse of the structure of scientific atheism in 1991. The article provides historical information on the development of the attitude of hierarchy of Russian Orthodox Church to the idea of university theology and on the role of the Church in development of state theological educational standards, as well as in introducing theology into the list of scientific disciplines. The article then discusses the debatable issues of qualifying theology as a scientific discipline. Drawing upon Habermasian approach, the author examines the meaning of the secular status of university education and the scientific status of theology in social and philosophical perspectives."

The author examines the text of German writer in line with hermeneutical and phenomenological traditions of contemporary psychology of religion, using the ideas of L. Vygotskij (\u201cThe Psychology of Art\u201d) and L. Ginsburg (\u201cOn the Psychological Prose\u201d) while analyzing the artistic component of the artwork, elements of contemporary Russian developmental psychology. Questions of Goethe\u2019s authorship and his attention to the world of religious experience of the female character of the novel are under discussion. Three main elements of psychological investigation of the novel are examined: the artistic method of Goethe; stages of formation of religious life of the character, the role of religion in the processes of socialization and individuation of her person; interaction of religious sense with other spheres, forms and functions of psychical life.\u00a0The article comes up with a number of conclusions concerning patterns of personal religious life in the modern times."

            "Abstract": "The article analyses theoretical approaches to religious motivation. It starts by identifying four core theoretical perspectives: selfdetermination theory, expectancy theory, sacralization theory, and religion-as-a-quest theory. In the self-determination approach, studies show the relationship between the level of religiosity, psychological well-being, and various psychological characteristics. The expectancy theory considers motivation as an assessment of achieving desired outcomes, depending on somebody`s opportunities and various situations. According to the concept of sacralization, particularly any target can be devoted to something spiritual, and thus religious motivation is not something special. Religion-as-a-quest theory considers religion as an attempt to answer important existential questions, reflecting the search for meaning. Overall, the psychology of motivation helps to understand many personal and socio-cultural processes connected with religion."

This article briefly highlights the main stages of development of psychology of religion, sets out the key ideas of leading scientists, and the current state of the discipline. The history of psychology of religion is a history of \u201cups and downs\u201d, in which Western and Russian traditions were clearly different. In the West, the development was more gradual and almost without serious interruption, and the main emphasis was on empirical research, while the history of the discipline in Russia was subject to political upheavals, which led to the domination of theoretical and historical works of descriptive nature."

The author pays special attention to its little-known and understudied aspects by referring to a wide range of sources from oral memoirs\u00a0to diary extracts. Of particular importance are photographic materials from state and private photo archives. The picture helps to provide a broader view of the history of Muslim community, both from the standpoint of a photographer and through the eyes of believers themselves. Special focus is made on the life of the two imam-khatibs of the Leningrad Cathedral Mosque: Yakub Halekov and Hafiz Mahmutov. The author examines how official and unofficial leaders and institutions governing Tatar-Muslim community in Leningrad and a number of towns in the Leningrad region emerged and worked. Some photographs coming from private archives often serve as a starting point for a broader study of forms of Islam in the Soviet Union."

            "Abstract": "This article examines the \u201cTibetan question\u201d in a broad historical context, the contemporary religious situation in Tibet and the Tibetan protest movement. It shows two diametrically opposed paradigms of the Tibetan issue \u2014 Chinese and Tibetan. The Chinese paradigm reduces the \u201cTibetan question\u201d to the issue of the Dalai Lama\u2019s status, while the Tibetan \u2014 to the issue of the Tibetan political status in relation to the Chinese state. Chinese authorities are trying to solve the problem through economic modernization, which they regard as the key to achieving stability and national unity. The author, however, shows the limits of the purely economic approach without taking into account the religious and political factors. The article deals with the escalation of the Tibetan protests in the form of the Buddhist self-immolations. The main cause of such escalation is a stalemate in the Sino-Tibetan dialog, further complicated by the Dalai Lama\u2019s old age. As the prospect of a breakthrough is hardly visible, the old confrontation seems to be the most probable scenario: Beijing does not make concessions to the Tibetan issue, while Dharamsala continues to adhere to tactics of pressure on the Chinese government through the internationalization of the \u201cTibetan issue\u201d."

This project in the field of sociology of religion and political theory explores conflicts over questions of public morality (f.e. visibility of religious symbols, definitions of family and gender, etc.). It starts from the observation that in today\u2019s world these conflicts no longer take place in national contexts, but have a global appeal. How can we understand this global struggle for traditional values? In order to answer this question two steps need to be taken: (1) a revised political sociology of traditionalist religious actors; (2) a revised political conception of moral conflict. The Postsecular Conflicts research project wants to achieve both of these steps, specifically through a thorough analysis of the role of Russian Orthodox traditionalist actors in the global struggle for traditional values."

Christianity sees the world, before all, as a display of the Divine; but faith is not just contemplation but also the way of salvation. Science is a sequence of falsified and verified theories. In religion, the knowledge of God is given in revelation, but refracted through a tradition, hence the importance of interpretation. Truth in science is a consensus of a competent community; truth in religion is also the consent with Church\u2019s dogmas but it is also ontological, a participation in God\u2019s life, a theosis. Religion and sciences have been in a constant interaction in history. The paper offers a positive strategy in dealing with these interactions \u2014 the so called .Leibnitz methodology. exploring metaphysical preconditions of scientific knowledge and finally producing a horizon for a certain natural religion."

The article outlines several approaches to the description of religion: Kantian, Hegelian, phenomenological, and analytical. The special character of religious thinking is defined by its participation in faith: religious thinking is like a meeting with an object of thought that reveals itself for the thought and thereby determines our thinking. The article also focuses on the role of metaphor in modern religious thought and shows that the metaphorical language of modern theology becomes an alternative to conceptual language. The author proposes a new methodology for dialogue between science and religion, which is based on the understanding of their fundamental otherness. The possibility of substantive dialogue is to explore the situation of human existence in the world."

The article demonstrates that there are three different aspects in understanding of scientific thinking. The first is based on \u00abdogmatic\u00bb tradition of the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century. The second considers science in the frame of critical rationality (K. Popper, H. Albert). The third demonstrates the irrational base of science and therefore its closeness to religion. The \u00abethos\u00bb of Scientific and of Christian communities are described in connection with all the three approaches. The article shows that each of these aspects implies the confrontation with the Christian way of thinking."

Theories postulating their harmonious coexistence are failures, and we need to understand the profound causes of conflicts. These causes are not in the sphere of particular or general cognitive disagreements, but in fundamental difference of spiritual settings, that stand behind both religion and science. The article distinguishes between the two main types of religious life and ethos \u2014 one connected with \u00abfaith\u00bb and the other with \u00abreligious experience\u00bb. It further distinguishes four basic forms of rationality: hypothetic-deductive (in natural sciences), hermeneutical (in human sciences), philosophical, and theological. Using these typologies helps showing the ways not so much of resolving particular conflicts that inevitably emerge, but rather of creating a mutual recognition in spite of fundamental differences."

Can religion, along with science, make valuable contributions to the public debate? Should scientific community respect this contribution, and if yes, then why? The article analyzes the two general considerations in favor of religious contributions. One is normative, connected with contemporary theories of democracy. Another one is epistemological, which, in turn, exists in two versions: weak or \"modern\", represented by Ju\u0308rgen Habermas and implying the necessity of \"translation\" of religious contribution into the language of universal secular rationality; and \"strong\" or postmodern, implying epistemological equalization of religion and science. Then the article considers concrete historical details of Russian culture (most importantly, its internal binary oppositions), which stipulate the social projection of the dialogue between science and religion in the Russian context."

The paper gives an overview of research results. The traditional dialogue (within Christian cultural tradition), which was largely epistemological, should be made wider and deeper thanks to new approaches \u2014 in particular looking comparatively at the very ethos of the scientific and religious communities. This aspect is most significant in Russia given the character of post- Soviet transition. Science and religion are not just the two different methods of knowledge but also the two different social institutions and cultural traditions. Now the context of their interaction is the crisis of modern paradigm of functional differentiation of society, as religion acquires wider public acclaim while science loses cultural hegemony. In these new circumstances, the dialogue opens some new perspectives: comparison of metaphysical foundations of both science and religion; exploring macro- and micro-social contexts in the production of scientific and religious knowledge; productive meeting of theology with social / human sciences."

The review emphasizes the need of de-Sovietization of the religious studies that in the Soviet times existed under the rubric of \u00abscientific atheism \u00bb. The volume\u2019s authors were right to present the Soviet religious studies as an amalgam of scientific and non-scientific approaches and practices. The Soviet scholars studied religion while they were expecting its near disappearance. With such orientation, it was almost impossible to follow thorough scientific procedures: the science as such was determined by the overall condicio sovetico with its unescapable mixture of what is what ought to be. The post-Soviet transition is supposed to be a way of de-ideologization, and this principle should be applied to such a new form of ideological bias as confessional engagement, which apparently has replaced the old \u00abscientific atheism\u00bb of the Soviet era."

Besides, secularism should mean our attempts to maintain relations of harmony and comity between the supporters of different religions and Weltanshauungen.

            "Abstract": "The article explores the relationship between the patronage of monasteries and territory control in Greater Armenia in the second half of the 9th century based on the study of three cases. The first is the foundation of the Monastery of Sevan by Princess Mariam Bagratid and the renowned ascetic Ma\u0161toc\u2018 in 871. It is suggested that this and other monastic foundations around Lake Sevan (Ge\u0142ark\u2018unik\u2018 territory) were a means of extending Bagratid influence, if not yet full control, on this neighboring region ruled by the Siwnids. The other two examples focus on the region of Vaspurakan and the patronage of Monasteries Hogeac\u2018 and Varag by Arcrunid princes. The geopolitical situation here was different. Arcrunis generally followed a centrifugal policy in relation to the Bagratid kings, partly because at that time they had no direct borders with central Bagratid territories. By establishing good relations and supporting the famous monasteries, the Arcrunids consolidated their grip in their newly conquered territories."

            "Abstract": "The article analyzes two cases of borrowing Zoroastrian mythological motifs by Syriac-speaking Christians during the period of Late Antiquity. The first example, attested in the writings of Ephrem the Syrian (4th c.), concerns the case of reinterpretation of the traditional image of biblical Paradise as a cosmic mountain, encircling the whole world. Most probably, it developed under a direct influence of the Iranian cosmological traditions regarding the mountain Alburz. The second example concerns the use of the figure of Rapitvin, known from Zoroastrian mythology, by the anonymous author of the Syriac composition known as the \u201cCave of Treasures\u201d (6th\u20137th cc.). The discussed examples of appropriation of some elements of Zoroastrian mythology by Syriac-speaking authors provide us with a valuable evidence on the complicated and multifaceted process of acculturation of the Christian minority to the culture of Sasanian Iran."

            "Abstract": "The Syriac poetry of the 11\u201314th centuries (so-called Syriac Renaissance) has been studied very poorly so far. One of the reasons is a traditional approach of the scholars, who treated this poetry as secondary to the strongly developed Islamic literature. The reason for changing of its character was the final fall of the Caliphate (1258) and the emergence of a new state in the area of Iran and Iraq with the Mongol dynasty, headed by Ilkhans (Hulaguids). The tolerance and sympathies of the rulers towards Christianity allowed the Syriac tradition to reach the royal palace, which also influenced the poetic style. In the article, an attempt is made to show how the poetry reflected political and social life of that period. Besides, it is argued that it had its original features, which were the result of the synthesis of its own traditions and the achievements of the Islamic culture. One of the creators of this new style was Gregory Bar \u02bfEbr\u014dy\u014d (1226\u20131286), a famous West-Syrian philosopher and scientist. His aesthetics was further developed by his East-Syrian contemporary Kh\u0101m\u012bs bar Qarda\u1e25\u0113 of Arbela, who used sophisticated rhythm and rhyme schemes to achieve a stronger effect on the royal court elite."

It highlights the historical relations between the Egyptian (Coptic) and Syrian Christian communities and the presence of Syrian monks at the monastic site in question, as well as in Cairo and in Egypt generally. The main textual evidence studied consists of epigraphical material that may be considered to be \u201csynodical inscriptions\u201d as they are shown to be related to the exchange of the well-established tradition of exchange of \u201cSynodical Letters\u201d between the patriarchs of the two non-Chalcedonian sister Churches. Four such inscriptions, dated to the 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th centuries A.D., are compared to external evidence and more particularly to Copto-Arabic historiography. In a concluding analysis, this phenomenon is briefly studied within the larger context of contacts and exchanges between the two communities and the migration of Syrian and other Oriental Christians to Egypt."

            "Abstract": "The present study attempts to determine the confessional background of the ninth-century Arab Christian translator of Plotinus, \u02bfAbd al-Mas\u012b\u1e25 ibn N\u0101\u02bfima al-\u1e24im\u1e63\u012b. Three scenarios are examined: that he was a Maronite, a Melkite, or a Jacobite. Given that we have, unfortunately, no primary sources that contextualize al-\u1e24im\u1e63\u012b within his Christian environment, any answer to this question must remain tentative. Nonetheless, it appears likely that al-\u1e24im\u1e63\u012b was a Chalcedonian (either a Maronite/monothelete or a Melkite/dyothelete) and not a Jacobite, and that he had some connection to Syrian or Palestinian Origenism. It is as part of this probable Origenist background that he became exposed to Greek Neoplatonism and gained access to a Greek manuscript of Plotinus. If he was a Melkite, it seems likely that he received his philosophical and theological education and was trained as a translator in one of the monasteries of Palestine\u2014such as the monastery of Mar Saba, which was a cutting-edge multilingual translation centre at the time, or the monastery of Mar Khariton. If he was a Maronite, he must have had ties to the likely Origenist milieu of the monastery of Mar Maron in western Syria."

            "Abstract": "In the histories of ecumenism, its initial formation is usually dated by the early 20th century. The World Missionary Conference held in Edinburgh in 1910 is referred to as its \u201csymbolic beginning\u201d. A quest for the origins of the ecumenical thought led researchers to find some early voices in the previous centuries, even as early as in the 15th\u201316th\u00a0c. However, there are Oriental sources which witness a much earlier formation of the ecumenical paradigm of the ecclesiological thought, typologically corresponding to the one developed in the 20th\u00a0c. In the Golden Age of Medieval Muslim culture under the \u02bfAbbasid caliphate, an ecumenical position is witnessed by some Middle Eastern Christian authors. In their works, the main Christian denominations are not polemically presented as opposed to each other, but on the contrary, the essential unity of various Christian beliefs is emphasized, and the ways the main Christian communities follow are claimed to be equal in value. The present article uses the Medieval Arabic sources to demonstrate that the history of the ecumenical thought should be corrected by supplying a chapter on the Medieval Eastern period of the history."

Although there in a great deal of literature concerned with the local and international political forces behind this coup, its timing has been considered only in passing. This article focuses on the fact that this event coincided with the major Christian festival of M\u00e4sq\u00e4l (The Festival of the Cross), an early Christian celebration, which was elevated to the de facto status of a major feast by the Ethiopian Church in the 15th century. The article analyses the coup in the light of three key M\u00e4sq\u00e4l themes of: (1)\u00a0Christianity\u2019s superiority over Islam; (2)\u00a0imperial presence (or absence) and power; (3)\u00a0appointment and dismissal. Using both historical accounts and ethnographic reports, each of these themes is explored in an attempt to deepen our understanding of the religious-cultural aspects of what may appear, at first glance, to be an exclusively political episode."

The 1832 Charter of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia became the basic legal document defining its particular goals and responsibilities before the secular authorities. One of the main ideas was to strengthen the role of Lutheranism in the life of the Finnish peasants. The Ingrian church, willingly or not, created conditions for the consolidation and promotion of the Ingrian identity of the Finns. It also led to the emergence of the Ingrian intelligentsia who elaborated the meaning of Ingrian identity."

The paper covers three periods of Catholic presence in the region: formation, institutionalization, and establishment, with an evolution from ethno-religious isolation to integration in the local cultural landscape. After the Revolution, the Catholics were subject, along with other religions, to rigid state policy, while practices were forced out to the private sphere. The Catholic Church institutions contributed to the preservation of the ethnic identity of the population historically associated with European, especially Polish, culture. They played a role in social protection for the most vulnerable population groups. Among other things, the data prove a particular role of religion in socially critical conditions."

Before the Revolution, the holidays contained a tension between the strict following of church calendar and the specific local sacral rhythm and collective memory. The paper explores the changes in the Soviet times, in particular in the postwar period until the early 1960s, when the tradition underwent a deep transformation. The paper draws upon the documents of the state Council of the Russian Orthodox Church, Party and local institutions, Komsomol, as well as the ethnographic data. By arbitrarily moving the borders of legality in the religious field, the authorities modified the tradition: the holidays were accepted within fewer registered churches while restricting other practices. This led to the interruption of the local memory of sacred places, and thus the former organic link between liturgical and mundane practices was broken. The festive date was recast as a secular pastime. The crisis of the tradition of holidays was completely secularized and transformed the entire peasant culture."

As a result, several variations of what we can call \u201cfolk Judaism\u201d emerged. One form is a forced refusal to follow the laws of Judaism and elaboration of various ways for breaking taboos. The second option is a conscious rejection of ancestral religious traditions, partly observing as a \u201ccamoufage\u201d, and minimal interaction with modern Orthodox Judaism. The third option is forming their own individual rules for observing selected religious commandments. Several key mechanisms of the formation of new Jewish \u201cfolk\u201d religious practices can be iden\u2011 tifed. They are the transformation of the existing halakhic regula\u2011 tions with the help of a) ritual fraud; b) changes in the status of the ritual object; c) application of the laws of ritual purity to an object known to be unclean."

It is based on historical research as well as ethnographic research carried out in the 1990s in Uzbekistan, and among immigrants (and the children of immigrants) in Israel and the United States. Rather than providing a description of wedding practices in catalogue form, the article show the ways in which such practices vary depending on historical and geographical context. Fieldwork in New York and Samarkand, for example, reveals great diferences in the weddings in both locales: in the atmosphere, in the timing of the event, in who ofciates, and in the sorts of people who are invited to attend. Despite these variables, ethnic entrepreneurs tend to portray Bukharan Jewish practices as static. Such depictions are part of a broader efort to capture and reify the culture of Jewish sub\u2011groups (often referred to as \u2018edot in Hebrew). Furthermore, the efort to freeze culture in the midst of post\u2011Soviet demographic upheaval, ofers a sense of belonging to an authentic, rooted culture."

            "Abstract": "The article deals with a disappearing community of Russian Judaizers (Subbotniks) in Armenia. The analysis of the folklore repertoire of the Subbotniks allows concluding that the very experience of breaking with the religious past is a foundation of their identity. The break happened in the second part of the 20th century and was accompanied by accepting the exonym \u201cSubbotnik\u201d which turned into a relatively stable ethnic category. This uncommon process can be explained using the distinction between \u201cgroups\u201d and \u201ccategories\u201d and the opposition of \u201cethnic\u201d and \u201creligious\u201d. The article considers the history of the use of the term \u201cSubbotnik\u201d and its complex connotations, referring to both Judaism and Christian sectarianism. In contrast to \u201cethnicity without groups,\u201d as coined by Roger Brubaker, the Judaizers show an example of stable communities that are particularly difficult to categorize. The Subbotniks of Armenia, who emerged as a \u201cgroup without categories,\u201d are now tuning into a \u201ccategory without group\u201d. The article shows a correlation between this transformation and the substitution of textual (religious) foundations of daily practices by the ethnic ones."

Based on published sources as well as interviews with people from various groups of Moscow Jewry, the research analyzes key strategies of community building and selfrepresentation of Chabad and Progressive Judaism, on the one hand, and the reception of these strategies and related practices, on the other. The study of these data allows to explicate the rapid and seemingly comprehensive success of Chabad as opposed to the failure of Reform Judaism in post-Soviet Russia, as well as some other alternatives in religious behavior of Moscow Jews including either the establishment of small communities or sticking to the Orthodox Choral synagogue albeit without regular attendance."

            "Abstract": "Since the collapse of state socialism, Ukraine has been exposed to dramatic transformations in its religious landscape. This article analyses the effects of religious revival among the Jewish population of Odessa. It considers different trajectories and motivations of turning to faith and various ways to come to terms with religious observance, as well as controversies that these practices imply. The article also deals with how the new religiosity affects family relations. The author argues that for the most part newly observing Jews look at Judaism as a new way of being Jewish rather than a return to their familial legacy. In general, the author characterizes post-Soviet religiosity in Odessa as \u201creligious adherence\u201d in the sense of a state of mind as well as a space for the formation of spiritual life. This \u201creligious adherence\u201d leads to a new direction in perception of Jewish identity without entailing \u201cfull\u201d observance \u201d Religious adherence\u201d thus may include full, partial, short or long-term dedication to Judaism, which is seen as either a complementary to the old worldview or a replacement of it."

The late Soviet opposition of \u201catheists\u201d and \u201cbelievers\u201d had shifted to adapting a typical Israeli five-rank classification: atheists, hilonim (secular),\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0masoratim (traditional), religious Zionists, and haredim (religious ultra-Orthodox). There are three sources of the religious identity of immigrants from the former Soviet Union: some elements of the Eastern-European religious tradition passed on in families; some religious experiences, both modern and traditional, adopted in the late Soviet period and in Israel; behavioral models and practices ofreligious origins, which rather refer to the general Israeli civil culture. Contrary to common knowledge, religious identity of the first and especially the second generation of immigrants from the USSR have much more to do with the local Israeli experiences than the so called \u201cSoviet legacy\u201d."

They view this \u201choly site\u201d as a social product and the interplay of mythological narrative, archeological interpretation and a result of tourist practices. The production of mythos and \u201cinvented traditions\u201d are vital ways in which non-traditional religious communities in Okunevo remember, retell and rearticulate crucial aspects of their religious identity. Specified discourses, being considered as social logics of development of sacred site and forms of its representation, allow us to analyze this sacred space from the historical perspective."

            "Abstract": "According to secular views, some religious techniques of the self, such as complete subordination of a person to spiritual leader, seem to violate basic human rights, and hence unacceptable. Conversely, religious traditions have different views on the subject and his / her good, and how this good can be achieved. In today\u2019s world, however, religious groups have to relate their views with the secular environment, and, therefore, some self-cultivation techniques represent a mixture of different worldviews. This article examines the techniques of the self in contemporary Orthodox convents. It explores how the notion of spiritual growth is influenced by an inner contradiction within the Orthodox Christian concept of sainthood \u2014 namely, between the deep perception of one\u2019s sinfulness and the rising of virtues. The secular understanding of time, which exists in today\u2019s monasteries, emphasizes this contradiction and puts into question the possibility of spiritual growth. By concentrating on diachronic dimension of self-transformation techniques, this article challenges current understanding of the secular and non-secular agency."

In addition to the constructive contribution of the church to the civilized system of European nations, Pannenberg views destructive consequences of Christians\u2019 retreat from their true religious missions, seen in such dramatic events as religious wars and the extinction of the Christian state."

Comparison of the ideas presented in his early and later work provides an opportunity of reconstruction of Milbank\u2019s ontological conception and its relationship with his socio-political project. Radicalism of Milbank\u2019s methodological approach to the relation between \u201csecular\u201d and \u201creligious\u201d is based on deconstruction of ontological and gnoseological foundations of secular metaphysics and identification of its theological nature. Milbank advocates the possibility of bringing the theological discourse to the public sphere through a reinterpretation of the Christian intellectual and social practices. He explains essential connection between metaphysical philosophy and political philosophy as well as between epistemology as \u201crepresentation\u201d and the idea of \u201cpolitical representation\u201d. He discusses the project of Christian socialism, rooted in the realist Thomistic ontology and aimed at building a democratic society beyond secular political spectrum. This project is presented as going beyond current opposition of liberalism and conservatism."

            "Abstract": "Antiquity developed several types of interpretation of the myth: allegorical, rational (critical), pragmatic and euhemeristic (historical). We find all of them in the texts of Plato, who lived long before Euhemeras and Palaephatus. The article examines the well-known Plato\u2019s texts about Thamus and Theuth in \u201cPhaedrus\u201d (274c-275a) and \u201cPhilebus\u201d (18b-d), as well as thematically closest fragment of the \u201cPoliticus\u201d (274b-d). It is shown that the Platonic \u201ceuhemerism\u201d is one of the inner preconditions and basis in the teachings of Plato. We have in mind Plato\u2019s cosmology and view of history (movements of Cosmos), which gave the opportunity to talk\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0about Plato\u2019s \u201cearthly gods\u201d. Didactic story about gods Thamus and Theuth as earthly rulers could become a background for the doctrine of Eugemerus that the gods worshiped by people are the great kings of antiquity. Relationship among the teachings of Plato and Eugemer can be seen not only on the basis of analysis of the legend about Atlantis (this legend could be the model for the \u201cSacra Historia\u201d of Eugemerus). The fragment of \u201cPhaedrus\u201d gives us an example of the interpretation of the myth, which was peculiar to Plato, but it could be a prerequisite for the interpretation developed by Euhemerus. Moreover, in the text of \u201cPhaedrus\u201d we find a critical consideration of \u201crational\u201d interpretation of mythology. Plato rejected this strategy, preferring to create its own historical mythology, where \u201cEgyptian logos\u201d from \u201cPhaedrus\u201d had a definite place."

Before 1970s, when the \u201cconflict thesis\u201d widely dominated, these \u201cscientific naturalists\u201d were presented as heroes of science, courageous defenders of the theory of evolution from the assaults of Christian reactionaries. However, from 1970s on, the historians started to question the \u201cconflict thesis\u201d, and a new, \u201ccomplexity thesis\u201d has been formulated. The real position of Huxley and his colleagues turned out to be unclear in this new historiographic perspective: can we extend the \u201ccomplexity thesis\u201d to their thought? This paper is trying to find an uneasy answer to this question."

            "Abstract": "This essay aims to critically rethink the relation between the historiographical categorizations provided by the \u201cconflict thesis\u201d and the American controversies on evolution by analyzing the construction of biological and theological discourses which featured the works of Edward Drinker Cope, leader of the so-called \u201cAmerican school Neo-Lamarckism\u201d. As an authority in the American scientific community of the second half of the nineteenth century, Cope set forth a new conceptualization of design in nature based upon the active role displayed by organisms during their life. This assumption, in his own words, implied the reintroduction of theism in nature. Such case study, we argue, represents not only a great testimony of the permeable boundaries which characterized the interaction between scientific and extra-scientific discourses in the 19th century. It also seems to undermine the conflict argument as well as the idea that warfare was the norm in the American reception of Darwinism."

            "Abstract": "This article draws on the debates over evolution in the UnitedS tates to explore efforts to define and defend the boundaries of science. When the first organized opposition to evolution appeared in the early 1920s, antievolutionists insisted that evolution should not be taught because its speculaitve nature placed it outside the boundaries of science. By the last quarter of the century, however, they had largely abandoned that position in favor of arguing that creationism and intelligent design should themselves be regarded as science. This dramatic shift reflected a major reinterpretation of the U.S. Constitution, especially the First Amendment, which states, \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion\u201d. Until after World War II the U.S. Supreme Court limited the application of this provision to the federal government. That practice began to change in the late 1940s, when the Court began applying First Amendment restrictions against the establishment of religion to the individual states and public school districts by way of the 14th Amendment; by the early 1960s it was asserting a goal of \u201cneutrality\u201d with regard to religion in public education. Because teaching \u201cbad science\u201d does not violate the Constitution, opponents of creationism have embraced the tactic of demonstrating that creation-science and Intelligent Design are essentially religious doctrines \u2014 and thus that teaching them in public schools is unconstitutional."

            "Abstract": "Today, theistic evolution (TE), the idea that God created living world by means of the evolutionary process, is shared by the majority of those who seek to reconcile Christian religion with the findings of modern science. A history of this idea, the subject of the present study, can be divided into two periods. The first period, which lasted from 1870s to 1940s, coincided with so-called eclipse of Darwinism. During that time the major proponents of TE doubted natural selection as the main force guiding evolution. Instead, they thought that the assumption of Divine guidance is needed in order to explain the evolutionary progress toward complex life forms. The second period in the history of TE began in the 1950s, after the modern evolutionary synthesis was established. The renaissance of Darwinism in biology left no room for teleological approach, so the new generation of TE supporters was forced to see God as restrained by the rule of chance or, alternatively, as acting through chance events. Despite of these changes, the religious content of TE remained the same, namely, the accent on Divine immanence and skeptical attitude toward the traditional doctrine regarding the fall and redemption. The author hypothesizes that the way for TE was paved by the Augustinian tradition of Western Christianity."

The analysis of relations between science and religion allowed both thinkers to articulate the most general grounds of their philosophical systems. The article outlines a number of important common features in interpretations and conclusions of both philosophers. For both, the struggle between \u201cscientific\u201d and \u201creligious\u201d worldviews seems to be a confrontation of the two forms of false consciousness. For both, philosophical rationality is the supreme arbiter in the conflict of religion and science. They outline a project of philosophical theology according to which God reveals Himself not in religious feeling but in reason, in the depth of self-consciousness. Overall, both thinkers give a solution typical for Russian metaphysics: by opposing both scientific and religious obscurantism, they hope for philosophical mediation in the case of reestablishing of balance of divergent spheres of cultural and spiritual life."

Works of C. du Prel and P.D. Ouspensky, two prominent esotericists of that time, are in the focus of the study. Based on the analysis of their works, the article highlights several common ideas such as the critique of positivism; referring to psychology and idealistic philosophy as the basis of the proposed renovation of science; linking radical reform of science to the further development of humankind. An interest to Kant\u2019s philosophy was in accordance with Kant\u2019s own ideas that were influenced by esoteric literature, particularly, by E. Swedenborg: Kant\u2019s works could therefore be interpreted in esoteric manner. An idea of strict distinction of phenomenal and noumenal realms was particularly important for both du Prel and Ouspensky. From their point of view, one can bridge this gap by means of unusual experience that can be achieved in altered states of consciousness."

Psychology was one of the most popular disciplines in the ecclesiastical academies. Among Svetilin\u2019s students were future illustrious prelates such as metropolitan Antony (Khrapovitsky) and bishop Mikhail (Gribanovsky). In his lectures Svetilin discussed only the \u201cphenomenology of the soul\u201d i. e. empirical psychology, but despite this narrow subject he promoted some new and perspective theological paradigms. His students follow the thesis of Svetilin that philosophy, supplemented by empirical knowledge about a human being, will come to conclusions consistent with theology. This idea contributed to the origin of theological personalism which asserts that \u201cpersonal\u201d and \u201cnatural\u201d are independent in the human being. It is likely, that this idea was for the first time advanced by bishop Mikhail (Gribanovsky) in his \u201cIntroductory lectures\u201d."

            "Abstract": "Based upon the theories of Western researchers such as W. Hanegraaff, A. Faivre, and E. Asprem, the paper offers an analysis of the relationship between science and \u201cWestern esotericism\u201d in the 19th and early 20th century. It discusses the theory of \u201csecularization of Western esotericism\u201d that led to the formation of the two new distinct forms: \u201cromanticism\u201d and \u201coccultism\u201d. The fault line that divides them was the attitude toward modern science. \u201cOccultism\u201d of E. Blavatsky, A. Besant, C. Leadbeater, R. Steiner, A. Saint-Yves d\u2019Alveydre, Papus, A. Stoker, and the Society for Psychical Research, was a form of adaptation of esotericism to new scientific, positivistic worldviews and procedures. By contrast, \u201cromanticism,\u201d represented by the \u201cnew alchemy\u201d and \u201cintegral traditionalism,\u201d asserted incompatibility of esotericism and science and promoted esoteric knowledge as an irreconcilable alternative to the modern worldview."

Both this claim and the universality of scientific knowledge were put under question in contemporary culture. The notions of \u201ctransculturation\u201d and \u201ctranscultural contact zone\u201d are applied to the investigation of the global expansion of Modernity. The existing approaches to the understanding of the influence of Gnosticism and nominalism on the ideology of Modernity are compared and assessed. The so-called \u201cnominalistic revolution\u201d that was of great importance to the formation of early European science was also connected with the emergence of the contact points between religion and science thus creating zone of their future confrontation. The paper additionally draws upon specific Russian context."

The origins of such an anti-Christian doctrine are both materialism and pantheistic idealism.

Drawing upon some hitherto unedited Tibetan, Mongolian and Russian sources, the paper undertakes a detailed reconstruction of the events in Siberian Transbaikalia in the period of the Russian Civil War. An analysis of the personal notes by Tsydenov and the text of the Constitution of Kudun Buddhist state shows that \u201cKudun theocracy\u201d was a syncretic fusion of the traditional Buddhist understanding of the Buddhist \u201cDharmic state\u201d and modernist conceptions of republicanism and constitutional democracy. The Kudun theocracy should also be interpreted as a response of the Buddhist circles to the attempts of the Buryat secular nationalists to build the Buryat statehood based upon the idea of national self-determination. The Kudun project shows that Buddhism could serve as a foundation for state-building at the age of the early 20th century Russian political crisis."

The elimination of the temporal power of the Pope first incited hatred of the majority of Catholics, but gradually, mostly due to the moderate policy of the Government, the relationship with the Church became less tense. The Lateran Treaty in 1929 created the Vatican City State and restored some of the earlier lost Church privileges. The real changes towards secularism became possible only since 1984, after the revision of the 1929 Lateran Concordat. Still, according to 1984 agreements, in spite of the principle of equality of all religions, the Catholic Church retains special treatment."

The notion firstly appeared in the context of political controversy between Pope John XXII and Louis of Bavaria. Augustine of Ancona put religio Augustini in the context of a more broad term micro-religion (religio particularis) as opposed to macro-religion (Christianity). He also formed criteria for comparison of different micro-religions (Dominican, Franciscan, Benedictine, Cistercian, Augustinian) thus opening the door for further development of a particular \u201cAugustine\u2019s religion\u201d. The latter is based upon the idea of perfect life, an ideal for Augustinian hermits, which is also presented as an ideal of apostolic life."

It argues that there are a number of paths through which we might investigate Russian connections to the emergence of post-secularity, the collapse of the USSR and the post-Soviet revival of Russian Orthodoxy representing only the most obvious. A thus far less developed but important approach involves unraveling an intellectual-historical trajectory focusing on the influence of anti-Bolshevik Russian religious thought in the West. The article shows that after the founding of the Soviet Union, the anti-Bolshevik Russian emigration emerged as a significant vehicle for the transmission of Russian ideas in the West, contributing to the development of an anti-secular discourse with roots in the nineteenth century that was able to achieve some prominence thanks to the Cold War. This discourse associated religiosity with freedom and atheism with unfreedom. The author argues that this discourse, in the development of which Russian intellectuals played an important role, emerged in reaction against the perceived cultural threat of nihilism, and suggests that it is a similar concern over the possible consequences nihilism that has led to the emergence of the postsecular moment. The post-secular, then, might be defined as an intense confrontation with the problem of nihilism."

On the other hand we find fundamental similarities between Russian, European and American memorial traditions. The paper draws on detailed analysis of the spontaneous memorialization acts after plane crash incident in which ice-hockey team \u00abLokomotiv\u00bb died on the 7th of September 2011."

            "Abstract": "In the contemporary Orthodox hagiography the special type of saint has formed \u2014 blazhennyie staritsy (\u00abblessed female spiritual elders\u00bb). In some respect this type of sainthood succeeds to traditional \u00abfolly for the sake of Christ\u00bb. Yet the staritsy have their distinguishing features, and the main such feature is incurable disease such as blindness or motor function disorder. The meaning of such disorder can be interpreted as a sign of permanent liminality and the person\u2019s divine election. It indicates that while being alive she also belongs to the world of the dead (or the next world). The creation of these iconic narratives can be seen as attempts to democratize hagiographical canon by including some folk religious motives and images. Such \u2018folklorisation\u2019 of the genre of church hagiography expresses the idea that Orthodox faith has deep roots in the popular religiosity and therefore can be accessible to common people."

Dmitry Samarin\u2019s paper \u00abThe Parish\u00bb (1867-1868) is studied in detail. It shows that Slavophile oriented members of Zemstvo were critical towards the actual status of the parish and wanted to see it as an independent unit though a subject to the power of Bishop. They saw it as a public institution with property and an elected priest. Understanding of the parish as a public institution led to the constant attention of the Zemstvo to its fate and the regular appearance of projects of its transformation. These projects included providing clergy with regular salary and converting the parish into a small regional unit. The author comes to the conclusion that obstacles to the implementation of these projects were not only the negative reaction of the Spiritual Department, but deep fragmentation of Russian society, which created mistrust between the clergy and active laymen \u2014 members of Zemstvo."

Even if the word is not so new, it has gained a new conceptual relevance and specificity as a consequence of a deep scrutiny of classical theories of secularization. The paper takes for granted debates on theories of secularization, and tries to contribute to the clarification of the still vague notion of \u2018postsecular society\u2019, so far symptom of weaknesses of theories of secularization, or of a normative need for a fairer recognition of religious traditions in our liberal institutions. Working on J\u00fcrgen Habermas and Adam B.

The hypothesis is that the sacred space of death in city landscape, comparing to rural setting, is more open to innovation, and therefore the current social processes are better reflected, thus new articulated forms of identity representation and expression are developed. Historical cemeteries, as well as cemeteries of ethnic and confessional minorities, function as sites of memory and play an important role in the construction of current cultural landscape and historical map of Kosovo."

            "Abstract": "The study explores the conjunction of popular Islam with the Bektashi Sufi and Sunni traditions. The fieldwork of the Slav speaking Pomaks was conducted in the mountainous area of Rhodopi, in Greek Thrace. The analysis of this case study in the area populated by Slav speaking populations (the Pomaks) helps to understand critically the modalities of each religious tradition as well as their interconnections. As many examples show, the Muslim traditions seem to have different and often contrasting origins: while the Sufis and the popular Islam promote the principle of unity between human beings and nature, the Sunnis construct themselves around a constant and agonizing production of orthopraxy and in open dialogue with power. The dilemma between popular practices and Islamic scholarly tradition is further complicated by the impact of western theology, scientific worldviews, and the Pomaks\u2019 status of a linguistic as well as religious minority within Orthodox Greek environment. The transition from popular practices to more rationalized forms of religiosity generates a new field of dynamic confrontations."

            "Abstract": "During the last decades religion has faced significant changes and the number of new religions increased in post-communist countries of Eastern and Central Europe. In Serbia, these changes led to new legal frameworks for both traditional churches and new religious communities. Although neo-Protestant communities were founded in the late 19th and the beginning of 20th centuries, they could be classified as \u00abnew religions\u00bb since they became more visible after the fall of communism. Neo-Protestants have spread their teachings in ethnically and confessional heterogeneous environments, such as the northern Serbian province of Vojvodina, and especially among ethnic minorities. Unlike mostly homogenous traditional communities in Serbia, neo-Protestants emphasize the principle of trans-ethnicity and trans-nationalism. This paper shows the dynamics of neo-Protestant communities in the region as well as changes that occurred in religious identities of the converts. The paper also indicates how religious transformations lead to diversification within a community that seems mono-ethnic and mono-confessional."

While recent developments have led to the dominance of \u2018clash of civilisations\u2019 discourse in such situations, I here use detailed studies of the three sites where intercommunal mixing occurs to evidence a range of different modalities of interaction, spanning a spectrum from overt antagonistic intolerance through non-conflictual cohabitation to forms of sharing close to syncretistic practice. The paper investigates the elements of the social fields engaged by these communities that prompt hostility, permit coexistence, and promote identification, and inquires whether the more benign forms of interaction currently manifest in Macedonia are atavistic in settings increasingly marked by ethno-nationalism and fundamentalism."

This research tested the theoretical paradigm of communitas and the concept of \u00abantagonistic tolerance\u00bb. The results of the fieldwork show that the motives of pilgrims are similar and universal. While Roma Muslims and Christian pilgrims do not come up with a communitas, they do not get into conflict either. In the meanwhile, at the sanctuary, the relationship between Christian clergy and the Muslims represents an example of \u00abantagonistic tolerance\u00bb."

From the very beginning of its pilgrimage history, Medjugorje as a sacred place attracted believers of various religious affiliations. The intention of this paper is to open up a different perspective in contrast to one proposed by Bax, namely, a perspective of international and intercultural communication through the shaping of Medjugorje pilgrimage. By analyzing primarily narrative expressions, but also embodied experiences and material objects, the paper sketches situations and manifestations of such interaction and communication. At the same time, it points to the obstacles in the processes that have emerged from the construction and interpretation of cultural differences. The paper concludes with an attempt to show that Medjugorje may be seen as an example of interculturality, unless religion and identity are not approached as something given or as a kind of a ghetto."

Such interaction between communities belonging to different cultural and religious traditions may assume various forms and patterns. This paper focuses on one such example, a holy site of mixed devotion by Muslims and Christians, the shrine Zajde Ba\u0161\u0107e in Nish, which keeps the traditional practice of ziyarat in the changing social and cultural environment. The main role in maintaining this tradition is played by the local Roma minority. Recently the shrine went through certain changes: the common old narrative about the Muslim nature of the cult was complemented by another one, with a clear multicultural emphasis. The study of narratives, the site\u2019s architectonics and the co-practices of visitors help to understand the correlation between competing discourses and draw patterns of interreligious interaction."

On the other hand, the state sought legitimation from Christian institutions, as illustrated by the Concordat with the Roman Catholic Church and the establishment of the \u00abNational Reich Church\u00bb for the Protestants. In addition, the article shows that the formation of the Nazi ideology was not only the consequence of the social and political crisis of the Weimar Republic, but also resulted from the crisis of the secular culture."

What do these developments represent? This article offers a critical analysis of the Russian Orthodox Church\u2019s involvement in Russian politics. Offering a theological perspective, the paper shows that the Russian Orthodox Church fails to make proper use of its own theological tools when it chooses to act as a partner of the state, rather than as an independent political agent. One of the most devastating consequences of this choice is that the Church provides a symbolic legitimation of widespread and growing nationalism. The analysis is focused upon the social doctrine of the Church and the official publications on the human rights. The texts of these documents are then related to some alternative theological positions within the Russian Orthodox tradition. It is argued that this tradition possesses theological resources to enrich the political life with constructive contribution, while eschewing the rhetoric of cultural exclusivism and nationalism."

Analysis of Eastern Orthodox theology, of the idea of theosis (deification) in particular, shows that theological foundations of \u201chuman dignity\u201d in East and West are often closer to each other than it is usually assumed. Consequently, the actual borderline apparently runs not so much between East and West, but rather between secular and religious approaches. At the same time, the existing models of human dignity and human rights seem to have reached dead ends and need a new orientation in order to provide convincing responses to new challenges. The Eastern Orthodox teaching of theosis, as applied in the \u201cBases of the Russian Orthodox Church\u00b4s Teaching on Human Dignity, Freedom and Human Rights\u201d can offer a number of new insights that can be combined with western perspectives for mutual enrichment."

            "Abstract": "The article discusses the issue of the church autocephaly through the lens of the Carl Schmitt\u2019s theory of sovereignty. It starts from the premise that the concept of autocephaly is synonymous with sovereignty in the area of the inter-Orthodox relations. He uses Carl Schmitt\u2019s concept of sovereignty-as-exception as an analytical tool seeing proclamation of autocephaly by a local church as introducing a state of emergency (exception), from which, in turn, sovereignty is born. As an example, the article considers the history of the Russian autocephaly. The article also introduces the distinction between sovereignty and its limited version, which arises in situations when a mother-church grants autocephaly to her part. An alternative model is the Church of Constantinople\u2019s sovereignty derived from the \u201cprimacy of honour\u201d in the Orthodox diptychs. In this respect, the article considers the prospective Pan-Orthodox Council as claiming the supreme authority in Eastern Orthodoxy."

            "Abstract": "The article explores the milestones in the relationship of religion and ideologies since the Enlightenment. Religion and ideology exercised deep impact on each other. Thus, for instance, the divide between \u201cliberals\u201d and \u201cconservatives\u201d in the Church nowadays emerged under the impact of secular ideologies. In particular, this divide reflects the American bipolar political system. The roots of this division go back to the history of theological thought. They can be traced in two anthropological models, pessimistic and \u00a0optimistic, which diverge on the issue of human freedom. The ancient Christian doctrines can be also interpreted in terms of \u201cconservative\u201d and \u201cliberal\u201d proto-ideologies: for example, Arianism and Severianism could be regarded as conservative movements. Instead of setting the Church\u2019s monopoly on any ideological trend, either conservative or liberal, the article suggests to reconcile them following the example of the modern political systems where coexistence and competition of the liberal and conservative ideologies do not lead to the system\u2019s collapse, but contribute to their further dynamic development."

The article contains analysis of key assumptions and arguments of the author of the book who looks at the political regime of liberal democracy from the perspective of Eastern Christian ascetical theology. Position of the author of the book is considered through a possible distinction of several models of the Christian political theology: theology of \u201cusing\u201d (the political) versus a theology of \u201cparticipating\u201d (in the political) versus a-theology of anachoresis (withdrawal from the political). Papanikolaou\u2019s interpretation of traditional asceticism as compatible with liberal democracy is criticized, as well as his overall apology of a certain political regime, which seems arbitrary as the author avoids any formulation of specifically Christian political ideal as opposed to secular philosophical foundations of contemporary polity."

Gregory\u2019s strategy in making the hierarchy follows the order of links in the tree of Porphyry; however Gregory departs from it for the sake of harmonization of links of the hierarchy with the cosmogonical order of natural being described in the Bible. Fundamental dissimilarity in the structure of the hierarchies in the doctrines of Dionysius and Gregory is pointed out. This difference is connected with the shift in the meaning of the philosophical concept of \u201cparticipation\u201d. Dionysius\u2019s doctrine of the hierarchy of participating beings is analyzed. The connection of the principles with the Neo-platonic tetrad Goodness, Being, Life, Mind is showed. Dionysius\u2019s hierarchy of participating beings is compared\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0with corresponding Proclus\u2019s hierarchy as well as with the hierarchy in Gregory. It is concluded that Gregory\u2019s hierarchy influenced Dionysius\u2019s one in that regard, in which Gregory\u2019s doctrine of hierarchy is based on the biblical-cosmogonical order of natural being."

            "Abstract": "According to many analysts, there is a general affinity between Eastern Orthodoxy and nationalism, especially in Southeastern Europe. The present article aims to draw a more differentiated picture and shows that in Bulgaria, Romania and Serbia religious nationalism developed with different intensity and along different paths. Among the three countries compared, Bulgaria has the weakest tradition of Orthodox sacralization of both nation and politics. This feature is rooted in the fact that Orthodoxy in Bulgarian history has frequently functioned as a frame of transnational belonging to the \u00abOrthodox world\u00bb or as an instrument of Greek dominance, but also in its institutional weaknesses. In Romania, the influence of the Orthodox Church in society has been traditionally stronger than in Bulgaria or Serbia \u2014 a difference which can be traced back to the lower burden of Ottoman rule and a stronger historical continuity of Orthodox learning in the Danube Principalities. Here, intense Orthodox influence in society caused the secular elites to integrate elements of Orthodoxy into the national program. The Serbian case is the most contradictory one: it reveals a heavy disparity between a modest level of church influence on everyday life with a pervasive presence of national symbolism, due to the fact of Serbia\u2019s being at the perennial geopolitical fault line and therefore in permanent conflicts with non-Orthodox powers."

            "Abstract": "In this article the problem of the collision of different paradigms of religious and national identity in a multinational and multi-confessional Russian Empire is shown on the example of a debate about the model of the Orthodox parish in Finland. The debate revealed a conflict between the two legal systems \u2014 imperial and that of the Grand Duchy of Finland. The Finnish legislation was perceived in the Grand Duchy as a guarantee of national identity. Therefore, the question about the status of the Orthodox parish was central for the conflict between the imperial centre and the periphery, as well as the process of Finland\u2019s national determination. The paper shows that the Empire and its general religious legislation lost in this matter to the Senate and the laws of the Dutchy. At the same time, the discussion resonated the internal Orthodox debate about the improved, ideal organisation of the parish. From this point of view, the Finnish project aroused ambivalent reaction of the Orthodox. On the one hand, they rejected the Protestant influence and a too deep intrusion of the civil authorities into the life of parish community. On the other hand, the supporters of the liberation of parish from the Church-State tutelage hoped\u00a0that a detailed description of the parish self-government, given in the Finnish project, could be extended to the rest of Empire."

However the political activity of the Ukrainian nationalists was strongly limited by the Polish government. One of the few organizations of the Ukrainian people, capable to maintain social activity, was the Church. In Galicia the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church traditionally supported the Ukrainian national movement. By contrast, in Volhynia, where the Ukrainians belonged to the Orthodox Church in Poland, the population was generally apolitical and showed no interest in the Ukrainian nationalism. This paper explores the dynamic of growing Ukrainization efforts within the Church, starting with individual initiatives of using the Ukrainian language in worship and ending up with appearance of bishops who promoted the idea of Ukraine\u2019s political and ecclesiastical independence."

            "Abstract": "Drawing upon archival, published, and oral sources as well as recent studies on the correlation between religion and nationality, the paper argues that formal \u00abreunification\u00bb of the Greek Catholics with the Russian Orthodox Church has become a successful \u00absubaltern strategy\u00bb, ensuring the survival of the Greek Catholic Church through the Soviet period. The article demonstrates that the \u00abChurch within the Church\u00bb, coming into existence as a result of \u00abreunification\u00bb, was for decades preserving its separate identity within the Russian Orthodox Church. The \u00abChurch within the Church\u00bb did not oppose directly the regime\u2019s assimilation policy while positioned itself as a Ukrainian and therefore as a non-Orthodox (because a non-Russian) and even as a non-Soviet. Concrete research issues are examined within a wider context of the survival of the Church in the Soviet state."

The Church officially ceased to exist in 1946 after the \u00abreunification\u00bb with the Russian Orthodox Church. Nevertheless, the part of the Greek Catholic clergy and the faithful did not recognize this act and moved to the underground. The process of legalization and revival was accompanied by the growing movement for the Ukrainian national independence. At the same time, the Church continued to remain faithful to the Apostolic See, constantly emphasizing their belonging to the Catholic Church. The legalization of the Church involved not only the relationships with the states, but also with other churches \u2014 the Russian Orthodox Church, the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, and the Roman Catholic Church. The heated inter-religious conflict was deeply entangled with the issue of national and ecclesiastic identity."

The analysis showed that the imperatives of modeling the image of the Metropolitan varied according to the political situation and the dominant ideology. The article concentrates on current commemorative practices that contribute to the formation of apologetic image of metropolitan and his cult, especially after Ignatius\u2019 canonization by the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate). The figure of Ignatius serves for ethnic consolidation and complementarity in the context of an alien ethnic environment."

Ipatov. As a result of secularization, in the beginning of the 20th century a part of Mennonites gave up religion but continued to regard themselves Mennonites by culture, and Mennonite identity ceased to be strictly religious. During the Civil War, the confessional identity lost its traditional core \u2014 obligatory nonresistance. Ethnic assimilation and loss of German language have been forced by the deportation of 1941 and special settlement. The number of Mennonite identity carriers significantly dropped due to the bitter struggle with religion. Many Mennonites joined the Evangelical Christian-Baptists producing a further erosion of identity. After decline of religious persecutions, reproduction of Mennonite identity could take place in rare Mennonite congregations and families. As a result, Mennonite identity did not disappear but significantly changed."

Nowadays in America Russian studies and other country specific researches face some problems. Nevertheless, the conferences are hold and the articles published even in the regions, which are distant from the main scientific centers. Paul Werth makes an overview of sources helping to reconstruct the dynamic of religious freedom in Tsarist Russia. The historian analyzes interaction of religious institutes of Russian Empire and its administrative structure, national movements, and ideological climate. Werth demonstrates that in the imperial Russia infringement of religious freedom was an effect of relationship between religious institutions and political, administrative and social structure of Empire, but not the result of a particular worldview. The research of the Russian imperial experience helps to draw the more general conclusion in the religious studies and social theory. For example, the level of religious freedom is negatively correlated to the use of religion in the secular public life."

With the demise of this\u00a0worldview went the framework that had existed for some two thousand\u00a0years allowing Europeans to understand the world, their place\u00a0in it, their purpose and identity. This was a time of unmasking, dismantling\u00a0and satirizing of dominant truths, most of all, the truths of\u00a0Christianity. Laughing, jokes and parodies were tools of reconstructing\u00a0European identities. The author draws upon a variety of examples\u00a0from literature and art of the era, mostly on British material."

The second concerns major trends in perception of religious, mythological and magical worldviews within the philosophy of knowledge. The interaction between science and non-science were complex in the Middle Ages and Early Modern times, but this interaction, if mostly in hidden form, does persist even now when the hegemony of science is questioned."

            "Abstract": "Within the European Convention system, judgments have supported legal restrictions on hate speech, but also on blasphemy or religious defamation. The universal human rights instruments, particularly the ICCPR, are increasingly geared towards eradicating hate speech (speech that threatens the rights and freedoms of others), whilst forms of extreme speech that fall short of that category are to be protected rather than countered by states. The Human Rights Committee\u2019s recently adopted General Comment (No. 34) on freedom of expression, provides another strong indication that this is the envisaged way forward: repealing blasphemy and defamation bills, whilst simultaneously increasing the efforts to combat hate speech. This paper argues that it remains ever so important to continue taking stock of the legal justifications for restrictions that are suggested in this area and to scrutinize whether they are in fact sustainable from a human rights perspective \u2014 not only on paper, but also in actual practice. The paper compares and contrasts the universal monitoring bodies\u2019 approach to extreme speech with that of regional monitoring\u00a0bodies, notably the European Court of Human Rights."

A further set of considerations flows directly from the work of Donald Black in the sociology of law, and includes important variables such as status, intimacy, and third-party partisanship, as well as evidentiary processes and production. Finally, the work of William Chambliss has identified the dialectic processes of law development as useful in allowing us to understand how legal structures protective of religious freedom might be produced."

These materials are used to illustrate the peculiarities of postsecular situation in Russia. Two issues are analyzed with special precision: 1) \u00abpunk-prayer\u00bb and the religious / secular boundary; 2) \u00abpunk-prayer\u00bb and postsecular hybrids. The author emphasizes that postsecular processes do not follow one single pattern and that we can\u2019t talk about postsecularism\u00a0in singularity; instead we should talk about collisions between different normative models of postsecularism, each supported by it\u2019s own actors and activists. The materials of the case allow us to single out two such models: \u00abofficial\u00bb (supported by state and Church powers) and \u00aboppositional\u00bb (supported by political and Church opposition)."

The author aspires to identify key law enforcement patterns in this area. The article opens with a concise analysis of emergence of the \u00abreligious extremism\u00bb concept. It elaborates in detail on the working mechanisms of the anti-extremism legislation and argues that this legislation does not provide effective control (and the sphere of religion is not an exception in this regard). The author examines the motivation of leading anti-extremism actors and their contribution to the process of law-enforcement. The combination of religious and secular motives in law-enforcement not only results in arbitrariness but also fails to improve public security."

The author shows that the main problems in this field were, among others, the management of the rights of majorities (sometimes, the state churches) and minorities (and individuals); the correlation of European norms and principles, based on the Convention of human rights, and the different national legal systems, reflecting on special aspects of national and cultural identities. Drawing upon analysis of a few key cases in the Court, the author reveals major trends in the Court\u2019s approach to religion-related conflicts."

One can find analysis of law enforcement practice of ECHR and fluctuations of Court\u2019s strategy (as an example author analyses \u00abthe Lautsi case\u00bb). Author concludes that the policy of the Court could be characterized as transitional, but the direction of this transition is still unclear. The Court faces two possible alternatives: either the freedom of speech will be defended in all its fullness, or will the margins of appreciation of national powers prevail;\u00a0in the latter case, the national forces will control ideological, cultural and informational square under pretext of defending religion and morality."

The author concentrates on the logic of participants of this case and analyses this logic in a broad cultural and ideological context. On the base of the ECHR decisions for the \u00abLautsi case\u00bb three positions and three corresponding groups of actors are outlined: strict secularists, representing projective ideology; soft secularists, orienting on culture and representing reactive ideology; and the followers of religious ideology. This last group in current postsecular situation, characterized by new ideological struggles, tend to form alliance with the second group. The postsecular reading of this case allows author to certify the crisis of traditional European secularism and of the sense of justice in the sphere of interaction between religion and society."

Italy at the European Court of Human Rights, on crucifixes in the public schools, with two opposite Court rulings in 2009 and 2011. While analyzing the logic of both rulings, the author explores two interacting concepts: \u201emargin of appreciation\u201c and \u00abneutrality\u00bb. He believes, at the first ruling of 2009 the Court practice of margin of appreciation was ignored, and the principle of neutrality was imposed; while the second ruling, trying to introduce correction in this sense, made other mistakes by drawing upon disputable factual and normative argumentation. The case of crucifix thus reveals tensions between national legal systems and the conventional and European Law. Overall, today, cases about religious symbols in the public square serve as a medium for the European community to reflect upon its identity and the role of religion in this identity."

In spite of the lasting impact of postmodernist skepticism toward theories and the deconstruction of \u00abreligion\u00bb as a modern narrative, the period of 1990-2000s gave birth to a wide range of new theories. The main trend was a new interest to the methods and explanatory strategies of the natural sciences. However, this trend did not mean a simple return to old positivism but rather has been a search of integrating religious studies into a new field of cognitive research."

In this paper the authors conceptualize his life and career and his academic\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0methodology. Monograph \u00abReligions of the World: Experience of the Transcendence: Transpersonal States and Psychotechnique\u00bb (1997) takes a unique place in the legacy of Torchinov. Here he introduces a new conception based on transpersonal psychology of Stanislaw Grof. The perinatal and transpersonal experiences are the foundation of religion and religious experience. Torchinov offers an intuitive understanding of deep religious feelings by means of experimental science. Torchinov's model is not a way of interpretation of religion as such, but of specific parts of religious traditions. The benefits of his ideas are in limited, quite concise areas of its applicability. Torchinov believed that his concept is replacing reductionist views, essentially sociological ones."

This paper presents the review of researches using economic approach to the study of religion, which touchs upon the problem of the influence of state on religious sphere. The author uses economic models and comes to the following conclusions. First, economic reasons of intervention of the state into religious market are linked with positive social effect from activity of religious organizations. Second, the state in such a situation seeks to promote religious organizations, however, the issue of loyalty comes to the fore. The state regulates religious market and subsidizes only loyal religious organizations in order to control the expenditure of public funds. Religious organizations of traditional faiths often become loyal because of the wide experience of interaction with the government."

The author analyses approaches to religion by Durkheim, Weber, Parsons, Berger, Luckmann, Bellah, Luhmann, Turner, as well as anthropological concepts of religion by C. Geertz and M. Douglas. Special attention is devoted to functionalism in biblical criticism and historiography of early Christianity (one can find analysis of works by N. Gottwald, P. Brown and W. Meeks). From author\u2019s point of view, \"as a \u2018science of the sublime\u2019, sociology is locked into the paradox of the Kantian critique of metaphysics and of any claims to the representation of the absolute\". Author wants to show that \"all twentieth century sociology of religion can be exposed as a secular policing of the sublime\" and that this sociology of religion is manifestation of \"secular will-to-power\"."

This new conceptualization allows, firstly, to explain contradictions in the Masonic worldview; secondly, through reconstructing this worldview as an integral system, provide a key for understanding some enigmatic Masonic texts; thirdly, to evaluate a proper place of the Russian Freemasonry and its role as the \u00abthird pillar\u00bb of the Russian culture along with Orthodox Christianity and Enlightenment rationalism."

            "Abstract": "In recent years, a remarkable revival of interest in Kabbalah and Jewish mysticism has taken place in Israel, the United States and other Western countries. This revival, which includes a resurgence of Kabbalistic and Hassidic doctrines and practices, coincided with the emergence of the New Age and other related spiritual and new religious movements in the last decades of the twentieth century. New Age themes appear in various contemporary Kabbalistic and Neohassidic groups, and there are significant similarities between them and other recent spiritual and religious revival movements. This article demonstrates that central characteristics of the new spiritual culture appear not only in new Kabbalah and Neohassidic groups that explicitly use New Age themes, but also among more traditional forms of Jewish mysticism. These shared characteristics can be explained not so much by direct influences, but rather by the nature of both phenomena and the postmodern context as a whole. This article claims that the new \u00abpostmodern spirituality\u00bb reflects the\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cultural logic of late global capitalism and responds to the new social conditions in the postmodern era."

It proposes to view magic as an umbrella term, the use of which depends on cultural context, and thus the best approach the study of magic would be to define its boundaries for each particular culture separately, and to carefully examine whether a particular phenomenon belongs to \u00abocculture\u00bb in each specific context. The article then turns to the interpretations of magic in the post-Soviet space, finding, in particular, how \u00abmagician\u00bb evolved from being a person of knowledge to becoming a person of power, and how once negatively charged terms, borrowed from the Western occulture, were redefined with positive meanings."

It makes more sense\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to consider integral traditionalism as a religious or semireligious ideology, manifested in various forms of social action. In the West, this phenomenon is now approached within the field of the studies in Western esotericism, while in Russia scholars often tend to reduce traditionalism to its purely political forms, which may lead to distortions."

This phenomenon, which clashes with the image of secularization, is particularly notable among the youth of the counterculture. To further sociological analysis, a conceptualization of esoteric culture is proposed. It is further argued that esoteric culture has played a significant role in Western cultural change, in such areas as artistic\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0expressions, political ideas, and even scientific thought. Esoteric culture is thus treated as a source of ideational innovations in Western modernization."

It argues that the first, comparative-civilizational perspective, helps to understand modernization-processes in large cultural-civilizational units; whereas the second, post-secular viewpoint, focuses on actors and cultural domains within civilizational units and on inter-civilizational crossovers. The two perspectives are complementary. What we gain from this distinction is greater precision in the use of multiple modernities for explaining the place of religion in modern societies. The example of Russian Orthodoxy is used for clarifying the difference between these two perspectives: whereas from a comparative-civilizational view-point, Russian Orthodoxy may appear as Europe\u2019s \u2018other\u2019; from a post-secular viewpoint, Orthodox religion is part of Europe\u2019s religious pluralist landscape and partakes in an ongoing process of defining the meaning of European political and cultural integration."

I argue that in Russia all attempts at modernization, starting from Peter the Great and including its Soviet version, were oriented towards the western \u2018cultural program of modernity\u2019, as an ideal type, rather than toward creating some special \u2018Russian pattern\u2019 of it. I also believe that secularism has always been and continues to be an inalienable part of this \u2018western modernity\u2019, and therefore, in Russia, all Christian Orthodox discourses and religiously-inspired movements led not so much to the encoding of modernity with some special religious meanings, but rather to implicit modernization, or adaptation of religion itself\u2014even in spite of Russian Orthodoxy\u2019s explicitly anti-modern posture. Overall, my perception is that some widespread interpretations of Eisenstadt\u2019s idea go a way too far towards emphasizing multiplicity, and that the concept of \u2018postsecular\u2019 should be used very cautiously."

            "Abstract": "It is well known that Turkey is a country in a state of flux. The ongoing transi- tion from a Kemalist ideology to a post-Kemalist one has a deep impact on many different levels and domains of the Turkish national life. The Western-like profile of the Kemalist project of modernization is starting to leave room for alternative forms and understandings of modernity. From international relations and foreign policy to TV soap operas and fictions, just to mention two relevant and different examples, Turkey seems in search for herself. Part and parcel of this making of a new way to modernity is a revision of the idea of secularization and a move towards a new understanding of the place and role of religion (s) in national life. In other words, the shaping of an alternative form of modernity is parallel to a deep and highly contested revision of the Kemalist understanding of secularization. The paper will try to draw from the Turkish case some general consideration on the very idea of the postsecular, and its relationship with the notion of multiple modernities."

The spread of Pentecostalism leads not only to a new format of inter-religious relations, but also to the aggravation of the contradictions between the logic of nation-states and the logic of transnational movements, which go across national borders. The most important question touched by the author is the following: Does the spread of Pentecostalism give rise to a new form of modernity, different from both European and American, or is it just a mean that allows some African or Latin American societies to catch up with secular capitalism?"

In addressing this question, Thomas partly demonstrates his dependence on the legacy of his predecessors (Lactantius, Augustine, Pseudo-Dionysius), and partly shows considerable originality, connected mainly to the new ideas he has introduced into Catholic theology. Translation of articles from \u2018Summa Theologiae\u2019 and \u2018In Boethium De Trinitate\u2019 published here demonstrates, among other things, the impact that reception of new translations of Aristotle had on the Catholic ethics."

            "Abstract": "Although western medieval thinkers in general had a little interest in non-Christian religious traditions, one can find a sort of comparative study of religions already in the 13th century. As a rule, the purpose of such studies was to prove the superiority of Christianity over other religions, and the means used were often the instruments of \u2018natural human reason\u2019. Works of Roger Bacon (1214/22\u2013ca. 1292) is the most striking example of this approach. Bacon does not appeal to the text of the Bible while he compares one religion with another on the basis of their compliance with the requirements of \u2018moral philosophy\u2019 (Bacon\u2019s original version of natural theology). The article reconstructs three Bacon\u2019s classifications of religions, describes their place with- in the framework of his \u2018moral philosophy\u2019, and shows their relationship with his scientific ideas."

About 80 papers from Russia, Ukraine and the West were based upon a variety of recent case studies in this new field of inquiry focused on everyday religiosity rather than State policies or reactions of religious institutions. The conference addressed major topical theoretical issues about the Soviet type of secularity and the respective reshaping of religious practices. A number of key problems of methods and sources interpretation were equally central in dis- cussions. Some papers of the conference will be published in a special issue of this journal later this year."

The author believes that philosophers often ignore the empirical reality and the sociological data and concentrate upon \u00abbeliefs\u00bb instead of deeper levels of social imbedding of religion, religious practices, and everyday behavior and values. The shift of focus would suggest an emphasis upon new forms of religiosity and spirituality largely triggered and disseminated by globalization. The author distinguishes \u00abpolitical\u00bb (public) and \u00absocial\u00bb secularization; if the former trend is reversed by a return of religions into the public sphere, the latter one shows not so much the revival but rather the appearance of new forms of religiosity, whose sociological base has to do with the late modern pattern of \u00abthin solidarities\u00bb (instead of \u00abthick solidarities\u00bb of earlier times)."

In these conditions, neither secular model of religion, typical to Modernity, nor pre-secular understanding of religion / religiosity can be considered as fitting to socio-cultural reality. It is especially stressed that secular understanding of premodern religion distorts religion\u2019s nature by allotting it a fixed and therefore limited place in line with the idea and practice of functional differentiation typical to European societies of the Modern age. In this way the article unpacks the \u00abhidden\u00bb worldview behind the secularism as ideology. The main assumption of the author is that \u00abreligious\u00bb should be regarded as one side of a two-sided socio-cultural whole (the second side is \u00abeternal\u00bb secular) and that this scheme fits for different historical periods and particular sociocultural settings."

He suggests that we are currently witnessing (i) a highly significant departure from the \u2018old\u2019 model of liberal society that championed a sacred-secular divide, where the state was (only) a neutral umpire with a deliberately cultivated attitude of \u2018studied public indifference\u2019 to the \u2018inner life\u2019 of the vast host of (private) associations that it was obliged to impartially regulate, and (ii) a transition to a \u2018new\u2019 post-secular model of liberal society that champions and promotes a sacred-secular distinction (a complementary unity of distinct aspects), where the state is obliged to rethink itself and become (also) the state of its society. In this respect, it resembles the state in the era of Christendom. He holds that Rawls and Habermas are handicapped in their efforts to theorise post-secular society as a result of their strong anti-metaphysical posture."

Particular attention is paid to Karl Barth\u2019s ideas of the relationship between religion (or natural religiosity of human being) and Christian revelation. These ideas are interpreted not in form of theological exclusivism, but as a more complex position that combines various elements of exclusivism, inclusivism and pluralism."

            "Abstract": "This article traces changes in the practice of sacramental confession in the Soviet\u00a0period, from 1917 to 1991. The combination of secularizing pressures, church\u00a0closures, and fewer priests, meant that the routine, institutionalized aspect of\u00a0confession before 1917, which had made individual confession something familiar\u00a0to the average Orthodox Christian believer, vanished, replaced in most cases by\u00a0the general confession. On the other hand, for religious \u201cvirtuosi,\u201d confession\u00a0became a more central element of religious life. The enthusiastic revival of\u00a0individual confession in Russia after 1991 suggests that the changes during the\u00a0Soviet period served as a kind of trial period for some forms of confession that\u00a0were more similar to those of other traditions, only to have them rejected in\u00a0favor of returning to precisely what had distinguished prerevolutionary imperial\u00a0practice (and Roman Catholic practice before Vatican II): the linkage between\u00a0individual confession and partaking of communion. Perhaps the surprising thing\u00a0is not how much the practice of confession changed during the Soviet period in\u00a0response to secularizing pressures, but rather how little."

Such an evolution can be\u00a0explained by three reasons, in fact, processes: an \u201cemancipation\u201d of the ritual\u00a0from functions related to state control; the believers\u2019 sense of existential fragility\u00a0and insecurity under the Soviet regime, which made the Eucharist perceived as\u00a0a pre-death farewell; and the blurring of the boundaries between a more intense\u00a0monastic and ordinary lay practices."

            "Abstract": "Pilgrimages to monasteries or other holy places were a traditional religious\u00a0practice among Orthodox believers up to 1917. Despite the Soviet government\u2019s\u00a0proclamation of state atheism, it was only with the mass terror in the 1930s\u00a0that these practices disappeared. Yet in the context of World War II and\u00a0Stalin\u2019s following policy change towards religions, believers felt encouraged to\u00a0practice the pilgrimage again. This article examines a pilgrimage to the famous\u00a0monastery called \u201cRooted solitude\u201d (Korennaia pustyn\u2019) by the city of Kursk\u00a0(Central Russia). From 1944 onwards until the new antireligious campaigns\u00a0under Nikita Khrushchev in 1958/59, these processions attracted up to 20 000\u00a0pilgrims each year. Yet pilgrimages of this period differed from those practiced in\u00a0pre-revolutionary times: the prominent icon of \u2018Our Lady of Kursk\u2019 (Bogomater\u2019\u00a0Kurskaia Korennaja) was taken abroad in 1920 and the monastery was closed.\u00a0\u2018Holy spring\u2019 nearby was chosen by the people as its substitute. In its struggle\u00a0against such \u2018occurrences of superstition\u2019 the regime relied on the church\u00a0hierarchy prohibiting the clergy to participate in the procession or any open\u00a0air prayer sessions. Hence, the local bishop of Kursk was stuck in the dilemma\u00a0between abandoning an important Orthodox tradition and open denial of the\u00a0state instructions. This paper will analyze the bishop\u2019s decisions as well as\u00a0reactions of the laypeople."

            "Abstract": "Part of a larger research project about Soviet cultural consumption and identity\u00a0formation, this article explores the connection between religious practices and\u00a0western mass culture in the industrial city of Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine, in the\u00a0late socialist period. The Committee of State Security closed Dnepropetrovsk\u00a0to foreigners in 1959 when one of the Soviet Union\u2019s biggest missile factories\u00a0opened there. Because of its \u201cclosed\u201d nature, Dnepropetrovsk became a unique\u00a0Soviet social and cultural laboratory where various patterns of late socialism\u00a0collided with new Western cultural influences. The closed city of Dnepropetrovsk\u00a0can be seen as a microcosm of Soviet society as a whole. Drawing from a wide\u00a0variety of sources, including archival documents, periodicals, personal diaries\u00a0and interviews, this article demonstrates how popular fascination for Western\u00a0rock music, such as Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s Jesus Christ Superstar, spurred\u00a0interest in Christianity. Local Protestant and Orthodox church leaders skillfully\u00a0promoted such interest, even as the Party bosses tried to quash it. This study\u00a0stands as a reminder of the continued draw of Christianity in Orthodoxy\u2019s\u00a0heartland\u2014even through alternative, modernizing media\u2014despite the official\u00a0promotion of atheism."

Lived religion is revealed\u00a0in the ritualized death practices conducted in Western Ukrainian territories\u00a0annexed to the Soviet Union during World War II and where the Greek-Catholic\u00a0Church was prominent before being driven underground in the early 1950s. With\u00a0limited access to clergy and liturgy, this article provides an analysis of the lived\u00a0religious practices of Western Ukrainians that were mostly conducted in homes\u00a0and cemeteries to commemorate death primarily during the Khrushchev period\u00a0in this borderland region of the USSR. Such lived religious practices, not only\u00a0sustained religious sentiment during the Soviet period, they also were an integral\u00a0part of local cultures and identities."
