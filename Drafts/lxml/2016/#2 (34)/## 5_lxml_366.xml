      <abstract>
        <b>In post-Soviet Georgia, the relationship between the Georgian Orthodox Church [GOC] and the politics manifest itself in two ways: the instrumentalization of GOC by the political parties and the government, as well as the attempts by GOC to strengthen its political influence. This paper tries to go beyond a purely institutional level and explores the deeply internalized perception of Christian Orthodoxy as a core element of Georgian identity. Such perception leads to formation of different societal groups consolidated around different religious beliefs and political views. This article analyzes controversies and clashes between these groups during a conflict occurred on May 17, 2013, when a small antihomophobic event was attacked by a big group of counter-protestants. The study focuses on this case and uses, as its core methodology, in-depth interviews, participant observation and interpretive analysis.</b>
