      <abstract>
        <b>The article examines the efforts of the Holy See to include Christian moral and ideological guidelines in the political agenda of the European Union and Vatican’s attitude towards the process of European integration from its beginning in the 20th century to the present day. The article is primarily based on papal encyclicals, statements and letters. The research reveals that for decades European integration has been under the close attention of the Holy See and was perceived primarily as an opportunity to strengthen the position of the Roman Catholic Church in Europe. At the same time, the attempts of the Holy See to include priority issues (first of all, “Christian roots” as Europe’s ideological and moral basis) in the fundamental documents of the EU were unsuccessful. As a result, the Holy See has shifted its interest from the European continent to Latin America, Africa and Asia. Despite this shift, the study shows that the Vatican and the EU are conducting a full-fledged dialogue in areas that represent mutual interest.</b>
