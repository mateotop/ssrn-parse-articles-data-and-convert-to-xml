      <abstract>
        <b>This article examines a cleavage inside the Catholic Church in Poland between the followers of “open” and “closed” Catholicism. Drawing upon empirical research of “Radio Maryja” and Dominican Order activists, the author uses Pierre Bourdieu’s concepts to show that this cleavage is rooted in social (“class”) distinctions. “Open” Catholics have better education; “closed” Catholics are usually older people with elementary education. Yet these  distinctions do not affect the capability of people to adapt themselves to new economic realities. Author refutes the existing myth that “closed” Catholics are passive, lacking dynamism, and relying blindly upon old patterns of behavior. Both groups show similar religious attitudes, and the difference is more about the style of their Christian faith, rather than its content. “Open” Catholics are more reflective; “closed” — more emotional. Finally, the difference is a matter of taste and aesthetical preferences, more than anything else.</b>
