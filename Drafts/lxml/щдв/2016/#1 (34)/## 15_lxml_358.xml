        <b>The article examines the experience of studying the Local Council of the Russian Orthodox Church 1917–1918 by the international research community. The article shows the unprecedented interest towards this historical event, which went beyond the borders of the Russian church history and became a symbol of the renewal of church life. The Council´s activity is examined through the prism of the research interest of Russian and foreign authors. Particular attention is paid to the research project of German theologian and historian professor Günther Schulz, in the series «Church Reforms», which are dedicated to the history of preparation and activity of the Council, edited by archpriest Nikolai Balashov, as well as to the monograph by French Catholic theologian, priest Hyacinthe Destivelle.</b>
