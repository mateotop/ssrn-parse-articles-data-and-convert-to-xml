      <abstract>
        <b>Using the views of bishop Andrey ( Ukhtomsky) as an example, the article discusses an understudied problem of the attitude of Russian Orthodox priests to the theory and practice of Russian nationalism of the late 19th — early 20th centuries. The authors analyze the bishop’s views on national empowerment, political nationalism and the issue of the non-Russians (inorodtsy). It is demonstrated how bishop Andrey’s Slavophil views shaped his Russian nationalism. The authors also consider the reasons for bishop Andrey’s cooperation with rightwing parties and unions, as well as the events that led to his disillusionment with these political forces. This turn is documented by the inedited materials showing the debate on “the national issue” in press between bishop Andrey and right-wing politicians in 1910, which led to their final break. Based on bishop Andrey’s journalistic texts published between 1899 and 1917 the authors conclude that he endorsed Russian national self-assertion but never aligned himself with nationalism that he condemned as anti-Christian as long as it acquired xenophobic, racist and secular aspects. Ultimately, while remaining the supporter of the Russian national idea in its Orthodox and Slavophil interpretation, by 1917 he had become a staunch opponent of Russian political nationalism.</b>
