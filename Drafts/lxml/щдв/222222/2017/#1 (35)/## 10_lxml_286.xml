      <abstract>
        <b>The article explores the history of oicial “religious” travels to and from the USSR in the period of 1943 to 1985. The main sources are the documents of the Central Committee of the Communist Party. The study analyzes how the trips were prepared and realized, how and why were people from various religious confessions sent abroad and invited to the Soviet Union, and other related issues. The author distinguishes the following types of oicial missions: diplomatic, recreational, educational, religious‑functional, and pilgrimage. There were three key political objectives —  propaganda, information and recruitment. These trips played an important role as they established a systematic form of communication, which sometimes served as alternative to oicial diplomacy.</b>
