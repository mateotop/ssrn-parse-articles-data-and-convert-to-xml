        <b>The author considers All-Russian Church Council of 1917 – 1918th as a special phenomenon of the conciliar practice of the Orthodox Church. He analyses the composition and arrangement of the Council in its historical context, paying particular attention to the role of the laity and bishops. A strong representation of laity allowed to avoid the conflict between married and monastic clergy. In addition, this system of representation was the visible realization of the idea of sobornost’, which the Council of 1917 – 1918th considered to be essential to restore. Thus, it built a balance between the principle of sobornost’ and the Church as hierarchy based upon the principle of apostolicity. The latter was implemented by the special role played by the bishops’ meeting, which acted as dogmatic and canonical “filter”, testing the decisions, adopted at the Council. The article then explores the previsions for the future All-Russian local councils which were supposed to undergo important changes in composition and functions.</b>
