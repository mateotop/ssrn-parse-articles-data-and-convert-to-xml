      <abstract>
        <b>The culture of neighborhood with all its details that make up the cultural mosaic of the Balkans is manifested at the level of popular religiosity, in particular, in the cases of mixed pilgrimages and popular shrines with shared practices. Such interaction between communities belonging to different cultural and religious traditions may assume various forms and patterns. This paper focuses on one such example, a holy site of mixed devotion by Muslims and Christians, the shrine Zajde Bašće in Nish, which keeps the traditional practice of ziyarat in the changing social and cultural environment. The main role in maintaining this tradition is played by the local Roma minority. Recently the shrine went through certain changes: the common old narrative about the Muslim nature of the cult was complemented by another one, with a clear multicultural emphasis. The study of narratives, the site’s architectonics and the co-practices of visitors help to understand the correlation between competing discourses and draw patterns of interreligious interaction.</b>
