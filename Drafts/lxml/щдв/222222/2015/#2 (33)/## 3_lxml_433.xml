      <abstract>
        <b>The article explores the relationship between the patronage of monasteries and territory control in Greater Armenia in the second half of the 9th century based on the study of three cases. The first is the foundation of the Monastery of Sevan by Princess Mariam Bagratid and the renowned ascetic Maštoc‘ in 871. It is suggested that this and other monastic foundations around Lake Sevan (Gełark‘unik‘ territory) were a means of extending Bagratid influence, if not yet full control, on this neighboring region ruled by the Siwnids. The other two examples focus on the region of Vaspurakan and the patronage of Monasteries Hogeac‘ and Varag by Arcrunid princes. The geopolitical situation here was different. Arcrunis generally followed a centrifugal policy in relation to the Bagratid kings, partly because at that time they had no direct borders with central Bagratid territories. By establishing good relations and supporting the famous monasteries, the Arcrunids consolidated their grip in their newly conquered territories.</b>
