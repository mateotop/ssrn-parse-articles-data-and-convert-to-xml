# ssrn-parse-articles-data-and-convert-to-xml
University summer assignment. The university journal wanted to upload articles to SSRN.com . This is a Python project designed to do some part of this task.

Unfortunately, the project is far from being completed. But it has a flexible xml template that you can use.

The main working code is located in the /app/grc.py

The rest of jupiter notebooks are drafts and most likely will not be useful, but just in case I left them here
