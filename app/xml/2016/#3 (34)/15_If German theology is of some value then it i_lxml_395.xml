      <abstract>
        <b>Dr. Bremer, who is member of the journal’s international board, tells his own story as professor of theology and discusses the issues of Catholic theological departments in Germany; structure of the theological departments; relationship between university and Church bureaucracies. His special focus is on the Concordat between the Catholic Church and the German Länder on the issue of training of clergy and teachers of religion. He also speaks of the relationship between the Catholics and the Protestants within the system of theological education. Bremer believes theology is a part of universitas litterarum and means a rational reflection about the faith in the context of academic freedom.</b>
