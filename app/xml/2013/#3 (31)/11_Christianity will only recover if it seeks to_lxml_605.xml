      <abstract>
        <b>In an interview given to our edition British theologian and philosopher John Milbank, one of the founders and leaders of interconfessional Christian intellectual movement "Radical Orthodoxy", tells about his intellectual formation, authors that influenced his thinking, as well as about his basic ideas and their connections to the Russian religious thought. He covers questions of contemporary correlations between religious and secular as well as about the place of theology and Christian apologetics in current postsecular situation. John Milbank also mentions that currently he is working on further elaboration of his ideas expounded in his work "Theology and Social Theory" (1990). The first volume "Beyond Secular Order", which is the result of this evolution, is planned for the end of 2013; he is currently writing the second volume, which will be called "The Representation of Being and the Representation of the People".</b>
