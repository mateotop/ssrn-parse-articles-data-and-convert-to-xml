      <abstract>
        <b>The article explores the imagination of childhood and parenting practices of contemporary alternative communities in Russia, which draws upon utopian religious and social ideals. Among those communities there are “ancestral (rodovye) settlements” of a New Age, Neo-Pagan movement “Anastasia,” or “Ringing Cedars of Russia”. The childhood, taken as a unique phase in human lifetime, is particularly emphasized: children are seen as little angels and great sages, because they are not corrupted by civilization. Parenting practices are based upon a conception of “natural parenthood.” Referring to “ancestral traditions,” the members of the alternative communities construct, in fact, a brand new tradition believing that their children will give rise to a new Generation (Rod) and a new humanity, which will solve all the social, political and ecological problems and create a new, just world order. The article draws upon field data at the Blagodat’ (Grace) settlement and a series of interviews collected in 2010–2011.</b>
