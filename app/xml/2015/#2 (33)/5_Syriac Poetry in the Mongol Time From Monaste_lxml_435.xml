      <abstract>
        <b>The Syriac poetry of the 11–14th centuries (so-called Syriac Renaissance) has been studied very poorly so far. One of the reasons is a traditional approach of the scholars, who treated this poetry as secondary to the strongly developed Islamic literature. The reason for changing of its character was the final fall of the Caliphate (1258) and the emergence of a new state in the area of Iran and Iraq with the Mongol dynasty, headed by Ilkhans (Hulaguids). The tolerance and sympathies of the rulers towards Christianity allowed the Syriac tradition to reach the royal palace, which also influenced the poetic style. In the article, an attempt is made to show how the poetry reflected political and social life of that period. Besides, it is argued that it had its original features, which were the result of the synthesis of its own traditions and the achievements of the Islamic culture. One of the creators of this new style was Gregory Bar ʿEbrōyō (1226–1286), a famous West-Syrian philosopher and scientist. His aesthetics was further developed by his East-Syrian contemporary Khāmīs bar Qardaḥē of Arbela, who used sophisticated rhythm and rhyme schemes to achieve a stronger effect on the royal court elite.</b>
