      <abstract>
        <b>This article analyzes how esotericists of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century used Kant’s philosophy to support their own ideas about the necessity of radical transformation of science. Works of C. du Prel and P.D. Ouspensky, two prominent esotericists of that time, are in the focus of the study. Based on the analysis of their works, the article highlights several common ideas such as the critique of positivism; referring to psychology and idealistic philosophy as the basis of the proposed renovation of science; linking radical reform of science to the further development of humankind. An interest to Kant’s philosophy was in accordance with Kant’s own ideas that were influenced by esoteric literature, particularly, by E. Swedenborg: Kant’s works could therefore be interpreted in esoteric manner. An idea of strict distinction of phenomenal and noumenal realms was particularly important for both du Prel and Ouspensky. From their point of view, one can bridge this gap by means of unusual experience that can be achieved in altered states of consciousness.</b>
