      <abstract>
        <b>This article analyzes an almost unprecedented religious situation, which emerged after the 1905 “Edict of Toleration.” The Edict set in motion a number of processes in Russian religious landscape and created a legal foundation of what may be called a situation of multi‑ Orthodoxy. The author explores the legal co‑existence of two church hierarchies who called themselves Orthodox: Russian Synodal Orthodox Church and Old Believers’ Church of Belokrinitsa agreement. The Edict and the following Circular no. 4628 marked a turning point for religious seekers who considered conversion from one church to another. A number of requests for re‑affiliation, sent to Belokrinitsa’s archbishop from representatives of various religious groups, mostly from the Synodal Church, sheds light on how this situation of multi‑ Orthodoxy operated, how it was regulated and what were the contra‑ dictions emerging on the boundaries of these two canonical domains.</b>
